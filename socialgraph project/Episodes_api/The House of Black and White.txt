The two then arrive at the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Black_and_White" title="House of Black and White">House of Black and White</a> on a boat. Arya lingers outside waiting for admittance, but is rejected by an <a href="/wiki/Noone" title="Noone" class="mw-redirect">elder man</a> despite showing the coin <a href="/wiki/Jaqen_H%27ghar" title="Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</a> had given her and mentioning their prior association. Arya waits outside the House for days, endlessly reciting the names of the people she's going to kill, but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of Braavos. While hunting for pigeons, she encounters several thugs who threaten to take her food and <a href="/wiki/Needle" title="Needle">Needle</a>. As she prepares to defend herself, the boys scatter when the man from the House of Black and White appears again. After following him back to the House, Arya demands he divulge his identity, and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before. His face morphs into that of the man Arya knew as Jaqen. Stating that "a man is not Jaqen H'ghar," he responds to Arya's question as to who he really is with the answer "No one. And that is what a girl must become" as he indicates that Arya may now enter the House. <p>Further south, <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> and <a href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a> depart <a href="/wiki/Pentos" title="Pentos">Pentos</a> in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses. Tyrion remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. Varys explains that they are travelling to <a href="/wiki/Meereen" title="Meereen">Meereen</a> by way of <a href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a>. Varys points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand of the King</a>, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a <a href="/wiki/Eunuchs" title="Eunuchs">eunuch</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarf</a>). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society. Tyrion is unmoved from his depression, and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. Varys again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly: Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. Tyrion scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill <i>every</i> dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him.... </p> <h3 id="In_King.27s_Landing_and_the_Crownlands" section="4">In King's Landing and the Crownlands</h3> <p>In <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> is presented with the severed head of <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_1" title="Dwarf 1">yet another dwarf</a>. Her offer of a lordship for Tyrion's head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as Tyrion. Cersei is irate, but won't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters. She wants the head disposed of, but <a href="/wiki/Qyburn" title="Qyburn">Qyburn</a> interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head, as it might be of use in some of his "experiments." </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":4}' data-ref="4"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/50/5x02-02.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150421183827"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%203500%202329'%2F%3E" alt="5x02-02.jpg" width="3500" height="2329"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/50/5x02-02.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150421183827" alt="5x02-02.jpg" width="3500" height="2329"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Cersei shows Jaime the "gift" from Dorne.</figcaption></figure> Cersei summons <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime</a> to their late father's office and reveals a "gift" from Dorne: an ornately carved viper, with Princess <a href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella</a>'s unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. She insists it is a threat against Myrcella, a conclusion Jaime can't refute. Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of his children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. He declares he will fix the situation with Myrcella and ignores Cersei's mocking of his one-handed status. <p>That issue dealt with, Cersei convenes the <a href="/wiki/Small_Council" title="Small Council">Small Council</a>. Sitting in the Hand's seat, she announces that "<a href="/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon" title="Tommen Baratheon">Tommen</a>" has declared <a href="/wiki/Qyburn" title="Qyburn">Qyburn</a> the new <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Whisperers" title="Master of Whisperers">Master of Whisperers</a> and that the position of <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand of the King</a> will remain vacant until Tommen is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself. Tommen has apparently also decided to make <a href="/wiki/Mace_Tyrell" title="Mace Tyrell">Mace Tyrell</a> the new <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Coin" title="Master of Coin">Master of Coin</a> in addition to his duties as <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Ships" title="Master of Ships">Master of Ships</a>, and extends the (just now made up) position of "<a href="/wiki/Master_of_War" title="Master of War">Master of War</a>" to <a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan Lannister</a>. Although Mace preens at his new responsibilities, <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> is outraged at Qyburn's promotion (as he was thrown out of the order of Maesters for conducting human experimentation). Kevan is disgusted at Cersei's blatant power play. Refusing the new position, he denounces Cersei as nothing more than the Queen Mother, berates her for abusing her authority to fill the Small Council with her sycophants. He then walks out, saying he will await King Tommen's own instructions - at <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a>. </p> <p>Further north in <a href="/wiki/The_Crownlands" title="The Crownlands">the Crownlands</a> at <a href="/wiki/Castle_Stokeworth" title="Castle Stokeworth">Castle Stokeworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed <a href="/wiki/Lollys_Stokeworth" title="Lollys Stokeworth">Lollys Stokeworth</a>. They seem to get on relatively well, but when Lollys reminds Bronn that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies, he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's coming to them, clearly setting his sights on the castle. Jaime finds the couple, and reveals to Bronn that Cersei has reneged on her deal and offered Lollys's hand to Ser Willas Bracken instead. Bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from <a href="/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a>, Bronn will receive a much better girl than Lollys, who has rights to a much better castle. </p> <h3 id="In_Dorne" section="5">In Dorne</h3> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/5x02-03.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150421184123"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%203500%202330'%2F%3E" alt="5x02-03.jpg" width="3500" height="2330"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/5x02-03.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150421184123" alt="5x02-03.jpg" width="3500" height="2330"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Ellaria and Doran discuss Oberyn's death.</figcaption></figure> In the <a href="/wiki/Water_Gardens" title="Water Gardens">Water Gardens</a> of <a href="/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ellaria_Sand" title="Ellaria Sand">Ellaria Sand</a> rudely demands an audience with <a href="/wiki/Doran_Martell" title="Doran Martell">Doran Martell</a>, the ruling <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Dorne" title="Prince of Dorne">Prince of Dorne</a>.

Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen, since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants; Daario indicates his men's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall, seriously injuring the man hiding behind it. <p>Back at the Great Pyramid, Daenerys and her council debate executing <a href="/wiki/Son_of_the_Harpy" title="Son of the Harpy">this Harpy's Son</a>, but the debate devolves into a shouting match between <a href="/wiki/Mossador" title="Mossador">Mossador</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hizdahr_zo_Loraq" title="Hizdahr zo Loraq">Hizdahr zo Loraq</a>.

Mollified by the revelation, particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies, Daenerys promises Ser Barristan that there will be a trial for the accused. Before the trial begins, Mossador kills the Harpy's Son. Daenerys, hoping to preserve the integrity of law, has Mossador publicly executed, causing the freed slaves to hiss at her and throw rocks at her as she leaves, along with a riot between the former slaves and masters breaking out. </p> <p>Later that night, Daenerys dismisses her council and goes outside.

The producers already confirmed that <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a> and his associated storyline will not reappear until Season 6. <a href="/wiki/Mace_Tyrell" title="Mace Tyrell">Mace Tyrell</a> does appear, representing House Tyrell, though Margaery, Loras, and Olenna do not appear. </li> <li>This episode marks the return of Cersei and Jaime's second child and only daughter, <a href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella Baratheon</a>. She was last physically seen back in Season 2 episode 6, "<a href="/wiki/The_Old_Gods_and_the_New" title="The Old Gods and the New">The Old Gods and the New</a>," when she sent off on a boat to Dorne. Myrcella was originally played by <a href="/wiki/Aimee_Richardson" title="Aimee Richardson">Aimee Richardson</a> in Seasons 1 and 2, but after a two season absence, the producers decided to recast the role now that Myrcella prominently features in Season 5, and the role is now played by <a href="/wiki/Nell_Tiger_Free" title="Nell Tiger Free">Nell Tiger Free</a>. </li> <li>This episode marks the first time that <a href="/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a> has been seen in the TV series, and the introduction of much of the rest of <a href="/wiki/House_Martell" title="House Martell">House Martell</a>, after the first view of them given when <a href="/wiki/Oberyn_Martell" title="Oberyn Martell">Oberyn Martell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ellaria_Sand" title="Ellaria Sand">Ellaria Sand</a> visited King's Landing in Season 4. This episode marks the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Doran_Martell" title="Doran Martell">Doran Martell</a>, Oberyn's older brother and ruling Prince of Dorne - played by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Siddig" title="Alexander Siddig">Alexander Siddig</a>, known for his role as Dr. Julian Bashir on <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>. <ul> <li>Dorne in the novels was loosely inspired by Moorish Spain, and by the time that the narrative was going to show it in Season 5, the unprecedented success of the TV series convinced <a href="/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> to invest the extra budget to actually film Dorne scenes in Spain, in the very medieval Islamic palaces which inspired the fantasy counterpart. </li> <li>Jaime euphemistically says that Dorne is "as far south as south goes." Way back in <a href="/wiki/Season_1" title="Season 1">Season 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/Osha" title="Osha">Osha</a> said that her goal after getting past the Wall was to go as far south as south goes, and whether or not she knew of Dorne, it is indeed the farthest south one can go in Westeros. </li> </ul> </li> <li>It took fifteen attempts for the Dornish "gift" box sent to Cersei to open properly (all the sides falling away at the same time to reveal the dead viper inside).<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> has been <a href="/wiki/Choosing" title="Choosing">elected</a> as the new <a href="/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Night%27s_Watch" title="Lord Commander of the Night's Watch">Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</a>. <ul> <li>The voting scene is significantly condensed from how this played out in the novels. Indeed, Jon's storyline is actually relatively behind several others. Unlike how <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a>'s storyline caught up with his material at the end of the fifth and most recent novel, the Night's Watch election occurs at the end of the <i>third</i> novel, right after the Battle of Castle Black. This got pushed into the beginning of Season 5, because the battle was used as the climax of the season in episode 9, so there wasn't enough time left over - though the producers have frequently said that they feel they are adapting the story as a whole, and have been willing to let parts from one book spill over into earlier or later seasons, instead of forcing the pacing by trying to make them neatly match up. </li> <li>In the novels, <i>every</i> member of the Night's Watch gets to vote - and there are about 600 men left alive in the Night's Watch at this point. Not all of them can come to Castle Black, but their commanders report how each garrison votes. The tally mechanism in front of Aemon visibly doesn't have nearly that many tokens in it. Moreover, it is impossible for there to be a tie in the novels, as such, because the office is won by a two-thirds majority. If no one candidate gets a two-thirds majority, voting just continues until a clear front-runner gathers enough votes, and other minor candidates drop out. Samwell shouting out Jon's name is fully within the rules: any black brother can put forward himself or another as a candidate (officers just stand a more realistic chance of winning than a stable boy). The production team apparently just wanted to make it visually clear how the voting went (long tallies of numbers would be more difficult to process). It is the equivalent as if Jon was one vote short <i>of</i> that two thirds majority, and Aemon added his vote to put him over the top. <ul><li>The animated Histories &amp; Lore video in Season 5's Blu-ray set titled "<a href="/wiki/The_Lord_Commanders_(Histories_%26_Lore)" title="The Lord Commanders (Histories &amp; Lore)" class="mw-redirect">The Lord Commanders</a>" describes how the elections work in the TV continuity, confirming that it has been changed from the books to be a simple majority, instead of a two-thirds majority. The video also confirmed that, as in the novels, votes from the other castles along the Wall were reported in by messengers (the TV episode just didn't make it very explicit). </li></ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Stannis offered that he would make Jon the new Lord of Winterfell and release him from his oath to the Night's Watch, but Jon tells Samwell that despite how much he wants to he will not, because his vows to the Watch were taken for life. Neither Jon nor Stannis were being unreasonable in this matter: Martin has said that there <i>have</i> been several times throughout history when men were legally released from their vows to the Night's Watch, often when they are in positions like Jon, when no other male heir is left to continue their family. On the other hand, while this <i>has</i> happened, the vows are taken very seriously, <i>meant</i> to be taken for life, and the handful of times that a few men were released from their vows over the centuries have always been very controversial. It was therefore not unlawful for Stannis to offer it, but at the same time, Jon was not being unreasonably stubborn by declining to be released from his vow. As Jon himself says in the episode, if he reneged on his vow of life-long service to the Night's Watch, many people would not take any future oath seriously that he made as Lord of Winterfell. <ul><li>Earlier in the novels, <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> planned to legitimize Jon and make him his heir should he die without issue, believing that <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a> were dead and having learned that <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa</a> had been married to <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a>, essentially handing the North to the Lannisters. He reasoned that the Night's Watch could be convinced to release Jon from his vows if he offered them 100 men in his place. However, the <a href="/wiki/Red_Wedding" title="Red Wedding">Red Wedding</a> took place soon after and no more was said of it. </li></ul> </li> <li>Ser <a href="/wiki/Denys_Mallister" title="Denys Mallister">Denys Mallister</a> was played by actor <a href="/wiki/J.J._Murphy" title="J.J. Murphy">J.J. Murphy</a>, who died only four days after filming his first scenes, at the age of 86. Co-creators <a href="/wiki/David_Benioff" title="David Benioff">David Benioff</a> and <a href="/wiki/D.B._Weiss" title="D.B. Weiss">D.B. Weiss</a> have announced the character will not be recast as Murphy "was a lovely man, and the best Denys Mallister we could have hoped for. And now his watch is ended."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> It is unknown if he finished every scene they intended to film with him, but apparently all or at least most of Murphy's primary scenes were already finished (it is possible that a few scenes were rewritten to work around his absence, i.e., in the preceding episode Samwell describes Mallister even though he is not present). Ultimately Murphy gave no speaking lines in the finished episode. In any event, in the novels Denys returns to the Shadow Tower after the election. <ul><li>Denys Mallister's supporter says that he joined the Night's Watch as a boy, and has served through ten winters: this cannot literally be true, and is either a dialogue error or his supporter should be understood as just speaking loosely (as if he said "a dozen" but was rounding). In Season 1, Tyrion stated that he has lived through <i>nine</i> winters, the longest of which was the three year winter his was born during - placing that ninth winter about 36 years ago (less in the novels, as Tyrion is a little older in the TV series). Mallister's supporter could not have meant that he "commanded the Shadow Tower through ten winters", because in the previous episode Samwell said that Mallister has commanded it for twenty years - which would contradict Tyrion's statement that there have only been nine winters in nearly forty years. Mallister is stated to have joined the Watch as a boy, and rounding that to 16, he was serving at the Wall for about 70 years: given the rough rate at which the multi-year seasons occur in Westeros, there had to have been more than <i>one</i> other winter between when Mallister joined the Watch seventy years ago, and when Tyrion was born nearly forty years ago. The summer that ended when King Robert died lasted ten years, and was stated to be the longest in living memory: seasons don't normally last that long, and given that Tyrion said in Season 1 that there were 9 winters in the 33 years he'd been alive, there had to have been other winters in that time period. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> shows Jon Snow a letter he received from <a href="/wiki/Bear_Island" title="Bear Island">Bear Island</a> when he asked for the allegiance of <a href="/wiki/House_Mormont" title="House Mormont">House Mormont</a>. He says he received a defiant reply from <a href="/wiki/Lyanna_Mormont" title="Lyanna Mormont">Lyanna Mormont</a>, the ten year old Lady of Bear Island, saying "Bear Island knows no king but the <a href="/wiki/King_in_the_North" title="King in the North">King in the North</a>, whose name is Stark." In the novels, Lyanna was similarly identified as the Lady of Bear Island to Stannis, though inwardly Jon thinks to himself that she actually isn't because she has older sisters, and wonders why she would be identified as such in the letter. As Jon says, Lyanna Mormont is the niece of Lord Commander <a href="/wiki/Jeor_Mormont" title="Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</a>, through his sister <a href="/wiki/Maege_Mormont" title="Maege Mormont">Maege Mormont</a> - who was last seen in Season 1 (without speaking lines), and who was the ruler of House Mormont and Bear Island at the time. In the novels, Maege is still alive, and was not present for the <a href="/wiki/Red_Wedding" title="Red Wedding">Red Wedding</a> because Robb sent her on ahead to the <a href="/wiki/Crannogmen" title="Crannogmen">Crannogmen</a> of <a href="/wiki/House_Reed" title="House Reed">House Reed</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Neck" title="The Neck">the Neck</a>, to prepare them for a push to retake <a href="/wiki/Moat_Cailin" title="Moat Cailin">Moat Cailin</a> from the ironborn. Her whereabouts after the Red Wedding are unknown. Lyanna is actually the <i>youngest</i> of Maege's five daughters, and her eldest daughter Dacey was a member of Robb's personal bodyguard who was killed in the Red Wedding. The exact situation in the TV series is unclear, but this doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean that Maege died off-screen in the TV version: simply that Lyanna is the <i>acting</i> Lady of Bear Island because she was physically left in charge there, just as <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a> was the acting "<a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Winterfell" title="Lord of Winterfell">Lord of Winterfell</a>" during Season 2 due to Robb's absence. <ul> <li>In the books, Lyanna apparently has changed her mind about supporting Stannis, for a Mormont force led by Alysane (Maege's second daughter) assists him <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Deepwood_Motte" title="Second Battle of Deepwood Motte">to liberate Deepwood Motte</a>. Stannis writes Jon about that: "we had other help, unexpected but most welcome, from a daughter of Bear Island. Alysane Mormont, whose men name her the She-Bear, hid fighters inside a gaggle of fishing sloops and took the ironmen unawares where they lay off the strand." That Mormont force joins Stannis in his campaign against the Boltons. </li> <li>Alysane comments that her sisters Lyra and Jorelle are with their mother. Hence, by default, Lyanna is <i>acting</i> "Lady of Bear Island", while her mother and older sisters are away, similar to how Bran Stark was the acting "Lord of Winterfell in Season 2 when his older brother Robb was not physically present to rule. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Even though <a href="/wiki/Shireen_Baratheon" title="Shireen Baratheon">Shireen Baratheon</a> was first introduced in Season 3, this is actually the first time that any explanation has been given on-screen for why half of her face is heavily scarred: she had the dreaded disease known as <a href="/wiki/Greyscale" title="Greyscale">Greyscale</a> when she was an infant. Against all odds she was able to be cured and survived, though it left half of her face disfigured. This is also the first time that "Greyscale" has been mentioned by name in the TV series. It is a leprosy-like disease found across both Westeros and Essos. <ul> <li>In the novels, <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a>'s sister-in-law Val (omitted from the TV series) later sees Shireen and warns that the girl is "unclean": Gilly loosely takes Val's place in this regard, though her reaction is much more sympathetic. The wildlings actually call it the "grey death": Gilly probably doesn't know this because she doesn't know much in general about the culture of other wildlings outside of <a href="/wiki/Craster%27s_Keep" title="Craster's Keep">Craster's Keep</a>. The TV series also invented the detail that two of <a href="/wiki/Craster%27s_wives" title="Craster's wives">Gilly's sisters</a> once caught greyscale and died, though this could have happened. Gilly says that Craster quarantined the girls in a hut, but when they were completely covered in greyscale and no longer coherent, he dragged them out into the woods by ropes to kill and possibly burn them. This is also not particularly more harsh than how those with greyscale are treated in centers of civilization like King's Landing or Pentos: those with greyscale are often mercy-killed, or burned to halt the spread, or exiled to essentially leper-colonies in the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Valyria" title="Valyria" class="mw-redirect">Valyria</a> (<a href="/wiki/Chroyane" title="Chroyane">Chroyane</a> in the books.) </li> <li>This is actually the first episode in which Shireen has ever interacted with her mother, Queen <a href="/wiki/Selyse_Baratheon" title="Selyse Baratheon">Selyse Baratheon</a>. <a href="/wiki/Kerry_Ingram" title="Kerry Ingram">Kerry Ingram</a> (Shireen) only had scenes with three people in Seasons 3 and 4: Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre, and only in her chambers set. In fact, Ingram said that she never even met <a href="/wiki/Tara_Fitzgerald" title="Tara Fitzgerald">Tara Fitzgerald</a> (Selyse), until they both appeared in the Castle Black set for the funeral pyre scene in the Season 4 finale. </li> <li>Shireen mentions that she was taught to read by old Maester <a href="/wiki/Cressen" title="Cressen">Cressen</a> - who was introduced as the maester at <a href="/wiki/Dragonstone_(castle)" title="Dragonstone (castle)">Dragonstone</a> in the Season 2 premiere, "<a href="/wiki/The_North_Remembers" title="The North Remembers">The North Remembers</a>", and died in the same episode. </li> <li>Although unmentioned when all three of them are in a scene together, Shireen, <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a>, and Selyse are all related. Selyse was born into <a href="/wiki/House_Florent" title="House Florent">House Florent</a>, and Samwell's mother - born Melessa Florent - was Selyse's first cousin, making Samwell and Shireen second cousins. </li> </ul> </li> <li>This episode also marks the first full-scale introduction of the Free City of <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a>. It was previously seen for the first time in Season 4's "<a href="/wiki/The_Laws_of_Gods_and_Men" title="The Laws of Gods and Men">The Laws of Gods and Men</a>", but other than a wide-shot of the <a href="/wiki/Titan_of_Braavos" title="Titan of Braavos">Titan of Braavos</a> and the city, that episode focused on just the interiors of the Iron Bank. For Season 5, the production team built expansive, fully realized sets of the streets and buildings of Braavos. <ul> <li>Captain <a href="/wiki/Ternesio_Terys" title="Ternesio Terys">Ternesio Terys</a> tells Arya that in the old days of Braavos, according to legend, the Titan statue would walk out into the ocean to rain down fire on attackers. The statue can't actually do this, but there are some elements of truth behind it: the Titan is not merely a decoration, but is a stylized fortification that commands the <i>only</i> major passage into the harbor, and the statue is filled with murder holes from which the defensive garrison can rain down fire and burning oil on enemy ships that try to pass. </li> <li>It isn't clear why no one in Braavos speaks <a href="/wiki/Low_Valyrian" title="Low Valyrian">Braavosi Low Valyrian</a>, but even a gang of street toughs apparently speak in the <a href="/wiki/Common_Tongue" title="Common Tongue">Common Tongue</a> of Westeros. Representatives of the Iron Bank such as <a href="/wiki/Tycho_Nestoris" title="Tycho Nestoris">Tycho Nestoris</a> know how to speak the Common Tongue because they are used to dealing with foreigners, as are sailors such as <a href="/wiki/Ternesio_Terys" title="Ternesio Terys">Ternesio Terys</a> (who brought Arya to Braavos), and also the Faceless men assassins. The Common Tongue <i>is</i> a major world language, and Braavos is extensively involved in international trade, so it is not implausible that perhaps the street toughs recognized that Arya was Westerosi by her clothing and appearance, and thus knew to speak to her in the Common Tongue. In the novels, Arya has to spend some time learning Braavosi Low Valyrian. </li> <li>Arya was last seen hunting pigeons in Season 1's "<a href="/wiki/Baelor" title="Baelor">Baelor</a>", when she was hiding out in the slums of <a href="/wiki/Flea_Bottom" title="Flea Bottom">Flea Bottom</a> in King's Landing. </li> <li>Arya's kill list doesn't mention <a href="/wiki/Ilyn_Payne" title="Ilyn Payne">Ilyn Payne</a> though due to the actor's pancreatic cancer it is unclear if he will return to the show in the future, even though it is stated that Ilyn Payne is still alive. In the novels, Arya didn't include people she didn't know about, and by the time she left Westeros information was still unclear on the role that <a href="/wiki/House_Bolton" title="House Bolton">House Bolton</a> played in betraying her family, so she didn't include them. It is commonly known that <a href="/wiki/House_Frey" title="House Frey">House Frey</a> betrayed her family because the <a href="/wiki/Red_Wedding" title="Red Wedding">Red Wedding</a> happened in their own castle. In the books, Arya doesn't include Walder Frey, however, or any Freys - though she gives the explanation that the only reason she doesn't include them is because it would take too long to recite the names of the over 100 living members of House Frey, <i>all</i> of whom she wants to kill. She also didn't include <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</a> because she wasn't aware of his capture of Winterfell at first, and by the time she left Winterfell reports were that the Boltons had retaken the castle and captured Theon, so Arya thought Theon had been dealt with. Arya briefly added Melisandre and the <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_Without_Banners" title="Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</a> to her list in Season 3 because she was angered that they sent <a href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a> away - a change from the novels, where she never meets Melisandre and Gendry remains with the Brotherhood - but apparently she simply removed them after a while (it wasn't nearly on the scale of what Cersei did to her, and though she didn't know it, Gendry came to no lasting harm). </li> </ul> </li> <li>In the novels, the member of the <a href="/wiki/Faceless_Men" title="Faceless Men">Faceless Men</a> that Arya meets at the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Black_and_White" title="House of Black and White">House of Black and White</a> can't be the real <a href="/wiki/Jaqen_H%27ghar" title="Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</a>, because he's still pursuing his original assignment in Westeros. Arya nicknames this other man as "the Kindly Man". In the TV series, a longer amount of time has passed, and Jaqen's other subplot seems to have probably been omitted. Therefore it isn't clear if in the TV continuity, it has been changed so that he actually is the <i>original</i> man that Arya physically encountered at Harrenhal, or, if he is just another shapeshifter who can take on the same appearance. Indeed, there <i>never was</i> a "Jaqen H'ghar", it was just a fake persona that the Faceless Man that Arya encountered happened to be using. Another factor is that the Faceless Men practice extreme self-abnegation, describing themselves as "no one", and basically consider each other to be interchangeable (if you aid one Faceless Man, you aid all of them, if you harm one, you harm all of them). <ul> <li>In an interview with <i>Vulture.com</i>, when asked about the return of actor <a href="/wiki/Tom_Wlaschiha" title="Tom Wlaschiha">Tom Wlaschiha</a> (Jaqen), and whether this was the Kindly Man taking on the face of Jaqen, or if the TV show changed it so that this really is the same Faceless Man that Arya encountered in Westeros, writer <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Cogman" title="Bryan Cogman">Bryan Cogman</a> sidestepped the issue by chuckling and responding: "He is no one. There is no Kindly Man. There is no Jaqen H'ghar."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> </li> <li>Jaqen gave Arya Stark his special coin back in the Season 2 finale, identifying her as a friend of the <a href="/wiki/Faceless_Men" title="Faceless Men">Faceless Men</a>, in gratitude for saving his life. She carried it around for two years before finally using it in the Season 4 finale to obtain passage to Braavos. </li> <li> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":9}' data-ref="9"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/41/502_facemask.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502181155"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201123%20630'%2F%3E" alt="502 facemask.png" width="1123" height="630"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/41/502_facemask.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502181155" alt="502 facemask.png" width="1123" height="630"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Free-frame reveals "Jaqen" pulls off his previous face like a mask.</figcaption></figure>Freeze-framing when the Faceless Man shapeshifts, as the camera swings behind Arya's head, reveals that he didn't simply wave his hand in front of his face and instantly turn into Jaqen's face once his hand had moved. Rather, he visibly <i>pulls off</i> the Old Man's face like a mask, as if it were a wet cloth sticking to his face. </li> <li>The actor who plays the old black man that Arya first meets at the House of Black and White is officially credited simply as "The Old Man". </li> <li>The Old Man raises another point: <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a> was founded by escaped slaves fleeing from the <a href="/wiki/Valyrian_Freehold" title="Valyrian Freehold">Valyrian Freehold</a>, who killed the masters commanding a fleet of slave ships they were being transported in and sailed as far away from Valyria as they could. The original slaves were from across the world, from <a href="/wiki/Andals" title="Andals">Andals</a> (like the people who live in southern Westeros) and <a href="/wiki/Rhoynar" title="Rhoynar">Rhoynar</a> (like the <a href="/wiki/Dornishmen" title="Dornishmen">Dornishmen</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Ghiscari" title="Ghiscari">Ghiscari</a> (from Slaver's Bay), and also from the <a href="/wiki/Summer_Islands" title="Summer Islands">Summer Islands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Naath" title="Naath">Naath</a> (like Grey Worm and Missandei), and even peoples from further east. As a result, there is no set "Braavosi ethnicity" whatsoever. Braavosi can be Northern European in appearance like the Lannisters or Baratheons (such as <a href="/wiki/Tycho_Nestoris" title="Tycho Nestoris">Tycho Nestoris</a>), or they can be Mediterranean-Greek in appearance (like <a href="/wiki/Syrio_Forel" title="Syrio Forel">Syrio Forel</a>), or they can be sub-Saharan African-black in appearance. The Braavosi are a cosmopolitan culture, not an ethnicity, and Braavosi people can be any ethnicity in the world. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Cersei says that she recognizes the Lannister lion pendant sent from Dorne stuffed in a dead viper's mouth to be her daughter <a href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella</a>'s, because there are only two pendants like it in the world: the one Cersei herself wears, and the one Myrcella has. Other Lannister lion pendants have actually appeared in the TV show other than these two: Joffrey gave one to Sansa in Season 1, and in Season 2, it became a minor plot point that Tyrion gave lion pendants to both <a href="/wiki/Ros" title="Ros">Ros</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a> - which led Cersei to mistakenly imprison Ros, thinking she was Tyrion's long-term lover. What Cersei apparently means in this episode is that the pendants she and Myrcella have are <i>exact</i> copies, i.e. she recognizes the maker's mark, and on a finer detail than the camera can see. Surely, the Lannisters have been putting lion sigils on their jewelry for generations: the idea itself is not unique, and there would be a wide variation on this design, but Cersei recognizes this as the <i>specific</i> Lannister lion pendant that belonged to her daughter. </li> <li>In the novels, <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a> did not personally go to Dorne, this is a condensation of the plotlines involving Myrcella. Instead, Jaime went to <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">the Riverlands</a> to take command of the ongoing siege of <a href="/wiki/Riverrun" title="Riverrun">Riverrun</a>, whose garrison (commanded by <a href="/wiki/Brynden_Tully" title="Brynden Tully">Brynden Tully</a>) had been completely surrounded by the Freys but defiantly continued to hold out for months after the <a href="/wiki/Red_Wedding" title="Red Wedding">Red Wedding</a>.

In the novels, hunters actually did behead one of the dwarf actors from the wedding, though the scene of Cersei being presented with a head involved a different dwarf that Brienne had met (Cersei does mention that she has been brought numerous dwarf heads by hunters who want the reward). Note that, as in the novels, the hunters crudely made a large slash along the dwarf's face to make it look more like him - though it isn't very convincing, because Tyrion's wound was <i>scarred</i> and this wound is obviously fresh. <ul><li>If you look closely during the scene in <a href="/wiki/Qyburn" title="Qyburn">Qyburn</a>'s lab, off to the side a large body is completely covered by a white sheet - apparently <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a>, whom Qyburn is still attempting to heal after he was poisoned with <a href="/wiki/Manticores" title="Manticores">manticore</a> venom (the very next episode after this confirms that Gregor is under the sheet). </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Lollys_Stokeworth" title="Lollys Stokeworth">Lollys Stokeworth</a> was first mentioned in Season 4's "<a href="/wiki/Mockingbird" title="Mockingbird">Mockingbird</a>", when <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> explained that Cersei bribed him with a marriage into the nobility - albeit to a younger daughter - if he would not be Tyrion's champion in the trial by combat against <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a>. Bronn accepted, because even if he wasn't bribed, he doubted he could defeat such a monstrously large and strong opponent as Gregor. Tyrion described her at the time as "dim-witted", though in the novels it isn't clear if she is meant to actually be a "<a href="/wiki/Lackwit" title="Lackwit">lackwit</a>" (i.e. has some sort of diagnosable mental handicap), or if she is just quite simple-minded and not very intelligent. <ul> <li>Lollys's gown features embroidery in the center with the <a href="/wiki/Heraldry" title="Heraldry">heraldry</a> of <a href="/wiki/House_Stokeworth" title="House Stokeworth">House Stokeworth</a>: a white lamb holding a golden cup, on a green background. </li> <li>There was some concern back when "Mockingbird" aired: within the same episode, <a href="/wiki/Oberyn_Martell" title="Oberyn Martell">Oberyn Martell</a> said that his father took him on a trip to Casterly Rock when he was young, where he encountered the newborn Tyrion, and also, Tyrion explained that Lollys's older sister Falyse would inherit Castle Stokeworth when her father died - when in the novels, Oberyn's <i>mother</i> was the previous ruler of Dorne, who led him on a journey to Casterly Rock, and Lollys's <i>mother</i> is the current head of <a href="/wiki/House_Stokeworth" title="House Stokeworth">House Stokeworth</a>. This led to some fears that female inheritance in Westeros, and the fact that sometimes Houses end up being headed by women, had been cut from the TV series. Apparently, however, the TV producers simply used condensed dialogue at the time because they felt it would take too long to explain <a href="/wiki/Laws_and_Customs" title="Laws and Customs">the intricacies</a> of Westeros's <a href="/wiki/Lordship" title="Lordship">inheritance system</a>. Later, in the <a href="/wiki/Histories_%26_Lore" title="Histories &amp; Lore">Histories &amp; Lore</a> animated featurettes included in the Season 4 Blu-ray set, Oberyn made it clear that his mother was actually the previous ruler of House Martell. In this episode, Lollys also confirms that her <i>mother</i> (whose name is Tanda Stokeworth) is indeed the current head of House Stokeworth, not her father. In-universe, Tyrion may simply have been mistaken and <i>assumed</i> her father was still alive when he explained this in Season 4. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/House_Stokeworth" title="House Stokeworth">House Stokeworth</a> is the first major House to be introduced in the TV series from <a href="/wiki/The_Crownlands" title="The Crownlands">the Crownlands</a>. This wasn't directly explained in TV episodes, but there are actually <i>nine</i> administrative regions within the "<a href="/wiki/Seven_Kingdoms" title="Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>". The bulk of Westeros, south of the Wall, used to be divided between seven large and independent kingdoms. <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">The Riverlands</a> were the borderlands in the middle of the continent, constantly fought over by the others. After the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Conquest" title="War of Conquest">Targaryen Conquest</a>, the new Targaryen kings elevated the Riverlands to be a new administrative subdivision, functionally the "eighth kingdom". Also, the Targaryens founded a great new capital city on the east coast of the continent, <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a>. To directly supply armies to the Iron Throne and to support the new capital, the Targaryens also carved out territory and lordships from the surrounding kingdoms to make "the Crownlands" - functionally a <i>ninth</i> "kingdom", not subject to one of the other Great Houses but sworn directly to the Iron Throne. After the Targaryens were overthrown the Crownlands continued to be directly ruled from King's Landing by Robert Baratheon. The TV series has not extensively shown before that there are more locations within the Crownlands besides King's Landing itself - on the mainland, that is; <a href="/wiki/Dragonstone_(island)" title="Dragonstone (island)">Dragonstone</a> is technically also part of the Crownlands but has a special status as a large island in Blackwater Bay. <a href="/wiki/Dontos_Hollard" title="Dontos Hollard">Dontos Hollard</a> was also from the Crownlands but he had no extensive lands. </li> <li>The <a href="/wiki/Small_Council" title="Small Council">Small Council</a> was gutted after the loss of <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>, Tyrion, Littlefinger, and Varys. Of the original Small Council when Joffrey seized power, only <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> still remains. In the novels, Cersei's takeover of the Small Council and stacking it with sycophants was a major running plotline affecting politics in the capital city. The TV version significantly condenses this, though keeping the general thematic points the same: <ul> <li>In the novels, Cersei appointed <a href="/wiki/Harys_Swyft" title="Harys Swyft">Harys Swyft</a> (Kevan's own father-in-law) as the new <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand of the King</a>, Orton Merryweather as <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Laws" title="Master of Laws">Master of Laws</a>, Gyles Rosby as <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Coin" title="Master of Coin">Master of Coin</a>, and Aurane Waters as <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Ships" title="Master of Ships">Master of Ships</a>. She appointed <a href="/wiki/Qyburn" title="Qyburn">Qyburn</a> as the new <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Whisperers" title="Master of Whisperers">Master of Whisperers</a> (spymaster) in both the books and TV series. <a href="/wiki/Mace_Tyrell" title="Mace Tyrell">Mace Tyrell</a> <i>was</i> the Master of Ships under Tywin (because after the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Fleet" title="Royal Fleet">Royal Fleet</a> got destroyed at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blackwater" title="Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</a> they need the Tyrell's large fleet), but Cersei grew so distrustful of the Tyrells that she removed him from the office and sent him to besiege Stannis's remaining garrison at <a href="/wiki/Storm%27s_End" title="Storm's End">Storm's End</a>. </li> <li>Given that these characters were not introduced in the TV series before and the audience wouldn't be familiar with them, Cersei's reshuffling of the Small Council in the TV version is condensed: Cersei isn't bothering to name a new Hand of the King at all, shockingly leaving the office vacant while functioning ruling over the council. In the novels, Cersei is technically still Tommen's <a href="/wiki/Regent" title="Regent">Regent</a> - but in the TV version, Tommen has apparently passed the age of legal majority in Westeros by this point, and she is no longer his regent: Kevan specifically says that she is only the <a href="/wiki/Queen" title="Queen" class="mw-redirect">Queen Mother</a>, and makes no mention of being a regent. A Queen Mother has no right to sit on the council if not a regent (though a king can <i>in theory</i> invite any advisors he wants onto his council - but Tommen isn't even present). Mace Tyrell is retained, and simply made <i>both</i> Master of Ships and Master of Coin. Qyburn is the new Master of Whisperers, and Pycelle remains Grand Maester. As Kevan was apparently going to point out, as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Kingsguard" title="Lord Commander of the Kingsguard">Lord Commander of the Kingsguard</a>, her brother Jaime is also supposed to be a member of the Small Council, but he has left the capital (though as it turns out, he volunteered to leave, to deal with events outside the city). </li> <li>In the novels, Tywin made his brother <a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan Lannister</a> the new <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Laws" title="Master of Laws">Master of Laws</a> (which was <a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</a>'s position back in book/season 1). In this episode, Kevan makes it clear that he was <i>not</i> made Master of Laws "off-screen" in the TV version, but was commanding armies in the field and only just returned to the capital city for Tywin's funeral - meaning that in the TV version, the office has apparently been simply left vacant since King Robert died, and it <i>remains</i> vacant. </li> <li>There is <i>no such thing</i> as a "<a href="/wiki/Master_of_War" title="Master of War">Master of War</a>". The crown's armies are commanded by the "<a href="/wiki/Protector_of_the_Realm" title="Protector of the Realm">Protector of the Realm</a>" (usually the king, unless he is underaged), who in turn commands the four <a href="/wiki/Warden" title="Warden">Wardens</a>. This reflects a more complex development in the novels, in which Cersei basically starts <i>making up</i> titles on the Small Council, at her whim (which she technically doesn't have the right to do either). In an act of petty resentment, she comes to loathe the idea of anyone else calling himself "master" in his title on the Small Council, feeling this means a loss of control. Therefore, she picks new names based on a few titles from the Free Cities: the Master of Coin is renamed the "Lord Treasurer", the Master of Ships is renamed the "Grand Admiral", and the Master of Laws is renamed the "Justiciar". She did try to make Kevan the new Hand of the King, but he bluntly refused her, openly told her that she completely failed as a mother to raise Joffrey, and demanded that she yield over custody of Tommen. She refused, and he returned to Casterly Rock. Essentially the same plot development happens here, though significantly condensing these characters and plotlines. <ul><li>In the books, Robb Stark also creats a new title - Warden of the Southern Marches, for his great-uncle Brynden Tully. Unlike Cersei, Robb has the right to creat a new title since he is a king, and he does not do it as a whim: in case Robb runs into troubles, the new title will give Blackfish the authority to act as a supreme military commander without hesitation or power struggles with other lords over command of the army. </li></ul> </li> <li>Cersei made the mistake of assuming that her uncle Kevan was her father's loyal lackey. Kevan makes it more explicitly clear in the novels that he really wasn't Tywin's puppet - he just happened to <i>agree</i> with his brother almost all the time, because Tywin was a political and military genius. </li> <li>Pycelle accurately points out that a <a href="/wiki/Grand_Maester" title="Grand Maester">Grand Maester</a> has been selected to also serve as Hand of the King on multiple occasions throughout history. Combined with the fact that he <i>is</i> the longest serving member of the council - indeed the only remaining one from King Aerys's, Robert's, or Joffrey's reigns - his request to be made Hand is entirely reasonable. Pycelle's disgust with Qyburn was previously explained in Season 4: he conducted human experimentation and vivisected living men in the pursuit of medical knowledge, for which he was expelled in disgrace from the <a href="/wiki/Maesters" title="Maesters">Order of Maesters</a> (headquartered in <a href="/wiki/The_Citadel" title="The Citadel">the Citadel</a>). Cersei emphasizes that she is making Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers based on loyalty, saying that Varys was disloyal - though in such a way that it seems almost a jab at Pycelle's loyalty. This is bizarre, and Pycelle takes it as such, given that he has been <i>nothing but</i> loyal to Cersei. In Season 2, Tyrion discovered that Pycelle was actually her spy on the Small Council, aided her against both <a href="/wiki/Jon_Arryn" title="Jon Arryn">Jon Arryn</a> (to his death) and <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>, and even spied on Tyrion for her, for which he was briefly thrown into the dungeons. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> recounted in Season 1's "<a href="/wiki/Baelor" title="Baelor">Baelor</a>" that Daenerys's father King <a href="/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen" title="Aerys II Targaryen">Aerys II Targaryen</a>, known as "the Mad King", was actually a normal and even charming man in his youth - and also lamented how his insanity was a late-onset and progressive condition, and how horrifying it was to watch as his friend gradually melted away before his eyes until after many years nothing was left of him but a raving lunatic. <ul> <li>The <a href="/wiki/Targaryen_madness" title="Targaryen madness">Targaryen madness</a>, the noted strain of insanity that ran in their bloodline, was the result of multiple generations of heavy compound inbreeding, <a href="/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">incestuously</a> marrying brother to sister to "keep the bloodline pure". Based on the example of her father and others, there is actually no guarantee that Daenerys (who is nearly 20 years old in the TV series) will not also suddenly and without warning turn violently insane twenty or thirty years in the future. </li> <li>Speaking privately with <a href="/wiki/Jorah_Mormont" title="Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</a> in Season 3 "<a href="/wiki/Kissed_by_Fire" title="Kissed by Fire">Kissed by Fire</a>", Ser Barristan openly described King Aerys as "a lunatic". His comments about how Aerys had men burned alive with <a href="/wiki/Wildfire" title="Wildfire">wildfire</a> and laughed, and had sons killed in front of their fathers, also refer specifically to how the Mad King killed <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>'s father <a href="/wiki/Rickard_Stark" title="Rickard Stark">Rickard</a> and his older brother <a href="/wiki/Brandon_Stark_(Son_of_Rickard)" title="Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)" class="mw-redirect">Brandon</a>. In the throne room itself, he had Rickard held aloft by chains while burning him with wildfire, and had Brandon dragged in front of him, attached to a torture device consisting of a noose around his neck, arranged in such a way that the harder he pulled on it the tighter it constricted. Brandon strangled himself to death trying to break free and save his father, while Rickard was cooked by flames so hot that the gold from his stirrups melted onto the floor. No one has mentioned which of them died first, though certainly, Aerys brought Brandon in to let both of them know that he intended to kill each of them. </li> <li>Jaime Lannister also remarked to Eddard Stark himself on encountering him in the <a href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a>'s throne room, back in Season 1 episode 3 "<a href="/wiki/Lord_Snow" title="Lord Snow">Lord Snow</a>", how odd it must be to stand in the very room where the Mad King had his father burned to death. Eddard points out that Jaime did nothing to save them, to which Jaime said that a room full of five hundred other men were too scared to do anything - and that when he ultimately drove his sword into Aerys at the end of the rebellion, his thoughts were of how the Mad King had laughed hysterically while Eddard's father burned alive. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Daenerys's decision to execute <a href="/wiki/Mossador" title="Mossador">Mossador</a> is similar to <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a>'s decision in Season 3's "<a href="/wiki/Kissed_by_Fire" title="Kissed by Fire">Kissed by Fire</a>" to execute <a href="/wiki/Rickard_Karstark" title="Rickard Karstark">Rickard Karstark</a>. In both cases it was punishment for killing a hostage, and the sentence could have been considered as just punishment, but it was unwise politically: Rickard's death sentence cost Robb the Karstark troops, while his position had already deteriorated as a result of the ironborn's invasion and the departure of the Freys; Daenerys's rule is unstable since she has many enemies among the former slave-masters in the region, and Mossador's public execution angered many of the ex-slaves who once fervently supported her. </li> <li> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":11}' data-ref="11"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Kill_the_masters_yet_again.png/revision/latest?cb=20150503004502"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201122%20632'%2F%3E" alt="Kill the masters yet again.png" width="1122" height="632"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/46/Kill_the_masters_yet_again.png/revision/latest?cb=20150503004502" alt="Kill the masters yet again.png" width="1122" height="632"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>"Kill the Masters" griffiti last seen in Season 4's "Oathkeeper".</figcaption></figure>The incongruous graffiti "Kill the Masters" last seen on a wall in Season 4's "<a href="/wiki/Oathkeeper" title="Oathkeeper">Oathkeeper</a>" is seen again in this episode, when the Son of the Harpy's corpse is left next to it.

Instead, she continued to wander through the war-torn Riverlands desperately hunting for the girls, and witnessing first-hand the utter devastation caused by the war - entire swaths of the region reduced to burned out ruins, and even with the war technically over, it would take a full generation to recover. Brienne's comment at the end that she saw Sansa traveling with Littlefinger on the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Road" title="Eastern Road">Eastern Road</a> indicates that they are still in the Vale in this scene. <ul> <li> <a href="/wiki/Gwendoline_Christie" title="Gwendoline Christie">Gwendoline Christie</a> (Brienne) explained in an interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that <b>a very important non-verbal instruction was in the script</b>: Sansa is not in a position to accept Brienne's offer because she realizes she is still Littlefinger's glorified captive, so the script instructed <a href="/wiki/Sophie_Turner" title="Sophie Turner">Sophie Turner</a> (Sansa) to shoot Brienne a look telling Brienne to "get the fuck out of Dodge".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> That is an American euphemism: basically the script specifically said that even as Sansa is <i>verbally</i> rejecting Brienne's offer, <i>non-verbally</i> she is trying to shoot Brienne an imploring look with her eyes to convey "I want to accept your offer, but get the hell out of here before Littlefinger has his guards kill you."
