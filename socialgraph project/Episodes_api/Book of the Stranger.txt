The High Sparrow respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin, citing his experience as a cobbler. Margaery manages to impress the Sparrow with her knowledge of The Book of the Stranger, which she admits Septa Unella had read <i>at</i> her. The High Sparrow chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them. </p> <p>The High Sparrow recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard. He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy, as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house. Tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence, the High Sparrow then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the <a href="/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven" title="Faith of the Seven">Faith of the Seven</a>. He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute.

Loras tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him. Margaery tells Loras that the Sparrow is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong. </p> <p>At the <a href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> walks in on <a href="/wiki/Grand_Maester" title="Grand Maester">Grand Maester</a> <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> advising King Tommen to accommodate the High Sparrow and the <a href="/wiki/Faith_Militant" title="Faith Militant">Faith Militant</a>. Cersei requests that Pycelle leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous <a href="/wiki/Small_Council" title="Small Council">Small Council</a> meetings. During their conversation, Tommen proposes that the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a> not antagonize the <a href="/wiki/Sparrows" title="Sparrows">Sparrows</a> further in order to avoid endangering Margaery's life. Cersei then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits Tommen's love for Margaery. She convinces her son that the High Sparrow has no respect for kings, queens, and society. Tommen then reveals a secret that the High Sparrow shared with him. </p> <p>Armed with this new information, Cersei barges into a Small Council meeting between <a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan Lannister</a>, <a href="/wiki/Olenna_Tyrell" title="Olenna Tyrell">Olenna Tyrell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>. While Kevan and Olenna are initially hostile, Cersei convinces them to listen to her. She then informs the Council that the High Sparrow has planned to make Margaery do the <a href="/wiki/Walk_of_atonement" title="Walk of atonement">walk of atonement</a>. Olenna is horrified that the Sparrows plan to debase her granddaughter. Jaime then urges the Council to allow the Tyrells to march their army into <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a>, crush the Faith Militant, and bring Margaery and Loras back to the Red Keep into Crown custody. Kevan says that Tommen expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the Great Sept, for fear that the Faith Militant will harm Margaery in retaliation. Jaime suggests that Olenna send <a href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a>'s army to the city instead, and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone <i>else</i> from trying, so Kevan wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives. The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept, intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. Kevan's interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. Cersei is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the Sparrows for taking his last remaining son and heir <a href="/wiki/Lancel_Lannister" title="Lancel Lannister">Lancel Lannister</a>. Olenna agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point, so it's better if it's the Sparrows' blood and not theirs. </p> <h3 id="At_the_Wall" section="4">At the Wall</h3> <p>At <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eddison_Tollett" title="Eddison Tollett">Eddison Tollett</a> helps <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> pack up his things.

To illustrate her point, the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen, a <a href="/wiki/Lhazareen" title="Lhazareen">Lhazareen</a> girl (<a href="/wiki/Ornela" title="Ornela">Ornela</a>) taken from her village at the age of twelve. Daenerys asks to relieve herself, and the high priestess sends Ornela with her. As they walk, Daenerys learns that Ornela's khal died when she was only sixteen. The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario, who take the Lhazareen hostage. Daenerys, unsurprised to see them, cancels their plans for escape – they have a slim chance of leaving Vaes Dothrak, let alone getting back to Meereen – and tells them that she has a plan of her own. She asks Ornela if she is willing to help them, calling her a <i><a href="/wiki/Khaleesi" title="Khaleesi">Khaleesi</a></i> (queen) instead of a <i>khaleen</i> (crone). The girl reluctantly agrees. </p> <p>During the <i><a href="/wiki/Khalar_vezhven" title="Khalar vezhven">Khalar vezhven</a></i>, the khals argue about how to deal with Iggo and Akho's deaths; Khal Moro defuses the situation by reminding them that <a href="/wiki/Ahko" title="Ahko" class="mw-redirect">Ahko</a> was a member of his khalasar, and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed. Daenerys is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before. Moro insists that she join the <i>dosh khaleen</i>, but another khal expresses interest in making her his <i>khaleesi</i>, while another suggests giving her to the <a href="/wiki/Wise_Masters" title="Wise Masters">Wise Masters</a> in exchange for ten thousand horses. Daenerys dismisses all of them; she claims that they are all petty and weak, and reminds them that Khal Drogo was willing to cross the "<a href="/wiki/Narrow_Sea" title="Narrow Sea">poison water</a>" in "<a href="/wiki/Ships" title="Ships">wooden horses</a>" for his conquests. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":8}' data-ref="8"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Book_of_the_Stranger_34.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160809141427"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%204928%203280'%2F%3E" alt="Book of the Stranger 34.jpg" width="4928" height="3280"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Book_of_the_Stranger_34.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160809141427" alt="Book of the Stranger 34.jpg" width="4928" height="3280"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Jorah and Daario bow down to their queen.</figcaption></figure><p>Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the Dothraki, Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself. After a pause, Moro and the khals burst into laughter. Dany reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a Dothraki army across the <a href="/wiki/Narrow_Sea" title="Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</a> to retake the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest. Disgusted with her insolence, Moro declares that she will be raped by each of the khals, then by all of their <a href="/wiki/Bloodriders" title="Bloodriders" class="mw-redirect">bloodriders</a>, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses. Daenerys is unfazed by the threats, as she knocks down the braziers in the hut, setting everything aflame. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly-spreading fire, only to find the temple's only door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside. </p> <p>As the flames climb higher, the <i>dosh khaleen</i> and <i>khalasars</i> gather in confusion. Eventually, the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges, naked and unburned, with the entire leadership present at Vaes Dothrak dead. Many of the assembled bow immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the <i>dosh khaleen</i> following after a moment. Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow last. </p> <h2 id="Appearances" section="10"> Appearances </h2> <h3 id="First" section="11"> First </h3> <ul> <li> <a

Pyke doesn't appear in the opening sequence, despite being a place of action in the episode and being present in the <a href="/wiki/Home" title="Home">previous episode</a>, where it wasn't featured. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/The_Stranger" title="The Stranger">The Stranger</a> is the aspect of <a href="/wiki/The_Seven" title="The Seven">The Seven</a> that represents death. The holy text of the <a href="/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven" title="Faith of the Seven">Faith of the Seven</a> is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Seven-Pointed_Star" title="The Seven-Pointed Star">The Seven-Pointed Star</a></i>, which is divided up into internal books (like the real-life Christian Bible, etc.) - i.e., one internal division is the "Book of the Maiden" (devoted to <a href="/wiki/The_Maiden" title="The Maiden">The Maiden</a>, another aspect of the Seven). The episode takes its name from when Margaery points out that the High Septon is quoting a verse from the Book of the Stranger. Only the Book of the Maiden has been mentioned by name in the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> novels so far, but it is presumed each aspect of the godhead has its own book. </li> <li>As <a href="/wiki/David_Benioff" title="David Benioff">David Benioff</a> directly points out in the <i>Inside the Episode</i> featurette, <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a> have never actually appeared together on-screen before in the entire TV series. Even in the series premiere "<a href="/wiki/Winter_is_Coming" title="Winter is Coming">Winter is Coming</a>," when the Stark children line up to welcome <a href="/wiki/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">King Robert</a> Jon isn't standing alongside them because he is a <a href="/wiki/Bastardy" title="Bastardy">bastard</a> (he stands behind them with Theon Greyjoy, as they share a similar position). He was also not at the feast. Similarly, Jon and Sansa didn't have any scenes together at Winterfell in the first novel - Jon was always closer to Arya, who was also a social outsider of a sort. <ul> <li>Sansa speaks to Jon about "the day we left Winterfell": they did indeed leave the castle on the same day, in episode 1.2 "<a href="/wiki/The_Kingsroad" title="The Kingsroad">The Kingsroad</a>." Jon took the opportunity to ask to join the <a href="/wiki/Night%27s_Watch" title="Night's Watch">Night's Watch</a>, so he rode along with the royal party the short distance to the crossroads then he and his uncle <a href="/wiki/Benjen_Stark" title="Benjen Stark">Benjen Stark</a> turned north, while the royal party turned south. </li> <li>Though Sansa and Jon don't have a particularly close relationship in the books, they think of each other several times throughout the series after their family's separation. Some examples include Jon recalling how Sansa had taught him how to talk to girls and, while regarding the beauty of a winter morning, fondly thinks that Sansa would call it an "<i>enchantment.</i>" In the fourth book, Sansa learns of Jon's new position as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Night%27s_Watch" title="Lord Commander of the Night's Watch">Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</a> while she is still hiding in <a href="/wiki/The_Vale_of_Arryn" title="The Vale of Arryn">the Vale of Arryn</a> with Littlefinger when someone mentions to her that Eddard Stark's bastard son was recently elected as Lord Commander. She then realizes how "<i>sweet</i>" it would be to see Jon again. In the TV show, Sansa is told about Jon's election in Season 5, but by Ramsay Bolton under different circumstances. </li> <li>Sansa and Jon have not reunited as of the end of the most recent novel: Jon's storyline in the TV series surpassed the novels when he was stabbed to death, while Sansa's has loosely surpassed the novels but also been heavily condensed: in the novels she stays in the Vale and never even meets the Boltons. It is entirely possible that she will meet Jon again in an upcoming novel and their reactions will be very much <i>similar</i> to this, though several details have of course been moved around. </li> <li>Sansa's view in this episode that she was "an ass" to Jon does seem to more or less line up with the descriptions given in the novels (though she's being self-deprecating, it's more that she was just arrogant). Sansa is very much her mother's daughter, and <a href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</a> completely ignored Jon Snow - she didn't mistreat him, but she <i>was not</i> his "stepmother," and in fact it was a great shame against her that Eddard brought Jon to live alongside her lawfully born children. Jon didn't think Catelyn's resentment was unusual and never expected more of her. Similarly, Sansa apparently didn't have much regard for Jon and apparently ignored him most of the time, so they didn't interact much even "off-screen" in the books. Jon was always closer to Arya, who was another social outcast of a sort due to her tomboy nature. An early chapter does have Arya mentally note that Sansa was always careful to refer to Jon as their "half-brother" and a "bastard" (as a legal term, not explicitly pejorative) - probably under the influence of Catelyn. On the other hand neither Catelyn nor Sansa ever mistreated or mocked Jon, they just avoided him. At one point, however, it was mentioned that Sansa did take time aside to help teach Jon how to properly court girls when he asked her to, so Sansa's relationship with Jon was evidently better than Catelyn's relationship with him was. </li> </ul> </li> <li>This episode features no less than three reunions between brother-sister pairs: Jon Snow and Sansa Stark, Theon and Yara Greyjoy, and Margaery and Loras Tyrell. <ul><li>The reunion between Sansa and Jon is the first time any of the separated Stark siblings have reunited since splitting up in Season 1 (except for Bran and Rickon, who separated at the end of Season 3). There were several chances of reunion - Arya arrived at the Twins right after the Red Wedding started, Arya's arrival at the Vale, Jon attacking the mutineers while Bran was nearby - but in every case the reunion was prevented for various reason, to the point where the Stark children almost reuniting but just barely missing each other has become a running joke in the fandom. </li></ul> </li> <li>As of the end of the fifth novel, both Jon and Sansa think the other three remaining Stark siblings - Arya, Bran, and Rickon - are probably dead. In the TV version, Brienne actually encountered Arya briefly and informed Sansa she was alive two episodes ago - information they can now share with Jon. <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</a> informed Sansa that Bran and Rickon survived the sack of Winterfell. Meanwhile, Jon actually knows that Bran and Rickon didn't die at Winterfell - Bran encountered <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a> as he was passing through the Wall (as he did in the novels) and made him swear not to tell anyone in the Season 3 finale. Unlike in the novels, however, Samwell later told Jon anyway, as seen in Season 4. Thus, if Jon and Sansa presumably shared information off-screen, they now know that there is at least some chance that all three of the other Stark siblings who were assumed dead might still be alive. <ul><li>Ramsay Bolton, meanwhile "preferred being an only child," killed his parents and infant half-brother, and is now the last living member of House Bolton - and the only people who fight for him are those he can intimidate into serving him. </li></ul> </li> <li>The encounter between <a href="/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Davos_Seaworth" title="Davos Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Melisandre" title="Melisandre">Melisandre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a>'s courtyard addresses several logical questions about how they would react to each other, in rapid succession. First, Davos is indeed curious about what exactly happened to <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shireen_Baratheon" title="Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</a> (whom Melisandre burned as a sacrifice). Second, Brienne accurately points out that she did in fact meet Davos before (and also Melisandre), as she was a member of <a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Kingsguard" title="Kingsguard">Kingsguard</a> - they met during the formal parley between Stannis and Renly back in <a href="/wiki/Season_2" title="Season 2">Season 2</a> episode 4, "<a href="/wiki/Garden_of_Bones" title="Garden of Bones">Garden of Bones</a>" (though Brienne didn't say anything at the time). Third, upon meeting Davos, Brienne bluntly admits that she "executed" Stannis (in the Season 5 finale), and that just prior to this Stannis outright confessed that he used blood magic to assassinate Renly (which she says while glaring at Melisandre, who killed Renly by birthing a <a href="/wiki/Shadow" title="Shadow">Shadow</a> monster in episode 2.5, "<a href="/wiki/The_Ghost_of_Harrenhal" title="The Ghost of Harrenhal">The Ghost of Harrenhal</a>"). </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Tormund" title="Tormund">Tormund</a> seems quite impressed with Brienne of Tarth - even though men in southern Westeros in prior episodes often thought she was some kind of freak or object of ridicule for being a strong female warrior. Recall that the <a href="/wiki/Free_Folk" title="Free Folk">wildlings</a> actually have a strong tradition of <a href="/wiki/Warrior_women" title="Warrior women">warrior women</a> - <a href="/wiki/Ygritte" title="Ygritte">Ygritte</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karsi" title="Karsi">Karsi</a>, etc. - so it makes sense that Tormund would actually think Brienne is impressive and/or attractive, instead of being dismissive to her like southern knights she has encountered in the past. </li> <li>In Season 5 it was said that Jon Snow and Tormund only managed to save about 5,000 wildlings by getting them to the southern side of the Wall. Tormund confirms now that only about 2,000 are in fighting shape, the rest are children, old people, etc.  Other than <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a>, the fate of the substantial number of fighting wildlings captured by Stannis following the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Castle_Black" title="Battle of Castle Black">Battle of Castle Black</a> has not been specified. </li> <li>Sansa says Ramsay remarked that the Bolton forces at Winterfell are around 5,000 men. It is unclear, but this might refer specifically to just the <i>Bolton</i> forces, not the added <a href="/wiki/House_Karstark" title="House Karstark">Karstark</a> and <a href="/wiki/House_Umber" title="House Umber">Umber</a> forces which came to Winterfell only after Sansa escaped at the end of Season 5. In the books, the Boltons had about 5,000 men at Winterfell itself, <i>not</i> including the forces from the other Northern Houses currently allied with the Boltons (who brought about another 3,000 men), which seems to match up with this. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</a>'s homecoming scene to <a href="/wiki/Pyke_(castle)" title="Pyke (castle)">Pyke</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Islands" title="Iron Islands">Iron Islands</a> after being a prisoner of the Boltons at Winterfell visually mirrors his earlier homecoming to Pyke in Season 2, after years being a "prisoner" (<a href="/wiki/Ward" title="Ward">Ward</a>) of the Starks at Winterfell. Just as in episode 2.2 "<a href="/wiki/The_Night_Lands" title="The Night Lands">The Night Lands</a>," Theon is first shown looking at Pyke from a ship, then when he enters the main hall encounters a family member upset with him. <a href="/wiki/Yara_Greyjoy" title="Yara Greyjoy">Yara Greyjoy</a> is framed the same way their father <a href="/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy" title="Balon Greyjoy">Balon</a> was in the previous episode: seated in a chair and looking into the fire, not bothering at first to turn around and face Theon while talking to him. </li> <li>The way <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>'s dialogue at the <a href="/wiki/Small_Council" title="Small Council">Small Council</a> scene is framed is somewhat confusing: <a href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a> actually has the largest army in Westeros, <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" title="House Lannister">House Lannister</a> the second largest, under normal circumstances. On top of this, <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> slaughtered half the Lannister army, while the Tyrell forces have comparatively been only lightly bloodied in the conflicts - and Tywin explained in Season 4 that the Lannisters are bankrupt and can't simply hire new <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" title="Mercenary">sellsword</a> armies anymore. In this episode, Jaime walks to the table and says "you have the second largest army in Westeros," but the camera is in wideshot so it is unclear if he is referring to his uncle <a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan</a> (commander of the remaining Lannister forces, which should now be the second largest) or to <a href="/wiki/Olenna_Tyrell" title="Olenna Tyrell">Olenna Tyrell</a>. He then goes on to explain that the Tyrell army will come to besiege the Great Sept, while <i>Kevan's</i> army already in the city simply stands down and doesn't try to stop them (which in contrast to his last sentence, would seem to imply that he was actually referring to Kevan when he said "you" have the second largest army). </li> <li>In the novels, Cersei was kept confined to chambers, and her uncle Kevan kept her under constant guard and wouldn't let her see visitors unsupervised. In previous episodes this season, Cersei wasn't under guard and it was vaguely implied she was free to move around the city, but chose not to out of fear for her safety. In this episode it is clearly stated that she is under house arrest, in that she is forbidden to leave the <a href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a> itself (she did leave to see Jaime and <a href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella</a> return at the docks, but presumably she would have received permission for that). </li> <li>As <a href="/wiki/Robin_Arryn" title="Robin Arryn">Robin Arryn</a> mentions, he is <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a>'s cousin - specifically her first cousin, as his mother <a href="/wiki/Lysa_Arryn" title="Lysa Arryn">Lysa Tully</a> was the younger sister of Sansa's mother <a href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Tully</a>. </li> <li>A promo image of <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> advising <a href="/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon" title="Tommen Baratheon">Tommen</a> in this episode was previously released for the Season 6 premiere. Either the scene was moved to this episode or - more probably, given the context - the promo image was simply mislabeled. </li> <li>The <a href="/wiki/High_Sparrow" title="High Sparrow">High Sparrow</a> hasn't given any backstory about himself in the current novels - it is unclear if the story he relates about himself in this episode is an invention of the TV series or will be revealed in a future novel. <ul><li>His story to Margaery, however, seems to conflict with his introduction to Cersei in episode 5.3 - to Cersei, he says that he gave his shoes away to someone who needed them more, while to Margaery, he says he left his shoes behind the day he walked away from finery. It's unclear which story, if any, is true. </li></ul> </li> <li>In <a href="/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell" title="Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a>'s prison cell, a large beetle appears, similar to the one that Tyrion chose not to smash in Season 4's "<a href="/wiki/The_Mountain_and_the_Viper" title="The Mountain and the Viper">The Mountain and the Viper</a>" (after giving a speech recalling his cousin <a href="/wiki/Orson_Lannister" title="Orson Lannister">Orson Lannister</a>). This is obviously not the same beetle - given that Tyrion was imprisoned in the dungeons of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a>, while Margaery is imprisoned on the other side of he city in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Sept_of_Baelor" title="Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</a>. </li> <li>Tyrion says that a clever man once said that you "make peace with your enemies," otherwise you'd already be friends. It was actually Littlefinger himself who said this to <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a> back in Season 1's "<a href="/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die" title="You Win or You Die">You Win or You Die</a>," urging he should make peace with the Lannisters instead of openly revealing that Joffrey was a bastard. Littlefinger never said this to Tyrion on-screen, but could easily have used the same line again at an off-screen Small Council meeting Tyrion attended in early Season 2. </li> <li>This episode once again brings up a discrepancy with the <a href="/wiki/Currency" title="Currency">currency</a> used in <a href="/wiki/Slaver%27s_Bay" title="Slaver's Bay" class="mw-redirect">Slaver's Bay</a>, the "Gold Honor" coin. In Season 5's "<a href="/wiki/The_Gift_(episode)" title="The Gift (episode)">The Gift</a>," <a href="/wiki/Yezzan_zo_Qaggaz" title="Yezzan zo Qaggaz">Yezzan zo Qaggaz</a> indeed bought Tyrion at a slave-auction for 1 Gold Honor, as he recounts in this episode. For <a href="/wiki/Jorah_Mormont" title="Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</a>, a well-trained knight being sold as a gladiator, the bidding started at 12 Gold Honors and he was bought by Yezzan for 20. In the novels, it is stated that a bid of 5,000 Gold Honors at auction for a pair of slaves sent to the fighting pits is actually thought to be an insultingly low offer. In the subsequent Season 5 Blu-ray set, the "<a href="/wiki/Histories_%26_Lore" title="Histories &amp; Lore">Histories &amp; Lore</a>" animated featurette on "<a href="/wiki/The_Fighting_Pits_of_Meereen" title="The Fighting Pits of Meereen">The Fighting Pits of Meereen</a>" contradicted this, by stating that a champion gladiator slave can be worth 300,000 Gold Honors - a figure much more closely in line with the relative value of the Gold Honor given in the books. Benioff and Weiss wrote both "The Gift" and this episode, while <a href="/wiki/Dave_Hill" title="Dave Hill">Dave Hill</a> writes the "Histories and Lore" featurettes - Hill understands the relative value of the Gold Honor given in the novels, but apparently never corrected Benioff and Weiss about this. <ul><li>The episode accurately displays that the <a href="/wiki/Dothraki" title="Dothraki">Dothraki</a> "don't believe in money" and don't use any form of currency. They will take precious objects as plunder if they come upon it, but otherwise prefer barter and tribute of inherently useful things such as new steel weapons and armor, or horses. Thus it is mentioned that Yunkai offered the Dothraki 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Horses" title="Horses">Horses</a> in exchange for Daenerys, as opposed to a large amount of Gold Honors. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> says that <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a> has not existed in <a href="/wiki/Westeros" title="Westeros">Westeros</a> for "centuries" - this is specifically true, though in fact it actually hasn't existed in Westeros for much longer, at least <i>thousands</i> of years. The <a href="/wiki/Andals" title="Andals">Andals</a> invaded Westeros <a href="/wiki/Andal_Invasion" title="Andal Invasion">6,000 years ago</a> but their religion forbade slavery, and the <a href="/wiki/First_Men" title="First Men">First Men</a> who moved to Westeros before them 12,000 years ago didn't believe in slavery either. As far as historians can tell, slavery has <i>never</i> been practiced in Westeros. <ul><li>The <a href="/wiki/Ironborn" title="Ironborn">ironborn</a> do skirt this a bit by keeping <a href="/wiki/Thrall" title="Thrall">thralls</a>, but thralls cannot be bought or sold and their children are born free (thralls are more like prisoners of war); even the ironborn explicitly believe full-fledged "slavery" is abhorrent. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Razdal_mo_Eraz" title="Razdal mo Eraz">Razdal mo Eraz</a> returns in this episode, the political envoy from <a href="/wiki/Yunkai" title="Yunkai">Yunkai</a> who was introduced back in <a href="/wiki/Season_3" title="Season 3">Season 3</a> episode 7 "<a href="/wiki/The_Bear_and_the_Maiden_Fair_(episode)" title="The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)">The Bear and the Maiden Fair</a>." He also summarizes his encounter with her from that episode: he outright offered her a fleet of ships to transport her army to Westeros and just leave Yunkai's slave-masters to their own devices, which he felt was a generous and mutually beneficial offer, but she refused and insisted on staying to topple the slave-masters. His return now is not an invention of the TV series due to economy of characters: after meeting with Daenerys in the third novel (much as he did in Season 3), he later returned in the fifth novel, in which he was one of the lead politicians arranging the Yunkai/Astapor/Volantis slaver-alliance now opposing Daenerys's rule over Meereen. </li> <li>In the novels, <a href="/wiki/Yezzan_zo_Qaggaz" title="Yezzan zo Qaggaz">Yezzan zo Qaggaz</a> was actually one of the <a href="/wiki/Wise_Masters" title="Wise Masters">Wise Masters</a> of <a href="/wiki/Yunkai" title="Yunkai">Yunkai</a> - though the character was significantly changed, as in the books he is morbidly obese and one of the more powerful slave-masters. In Season 5, he bought Jorah and Tyrion at a slave-auction on the outskirts of <a href="/wiki/Meereen" title="Meereen">Meereen</a> - seeming to imply that in the TV show he is one of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Masters" title="Great Masters">Great Masters</a> of Meereen, not of Yunkai. On the other hand, this never ruled out the possibility that he was a Yunkish slave-master <i>visiting</i> Meereen for the gladiator games (as it was stated the Yunkish slave-masters themselves wanted the games to open because they brought in a lot of money for the entire region). Now in this episode, it is stated that Yezzan is representing the (reconstituted) <a href="/wiki/Good_Masters" title="Good Masters">Good Masters</a> of <a href="/wiki/Astapor" title="Astapor">Astapor</a>. Exactly which of the three major cities of Slaver's Bay TV-Yezzan is supposed to be from is therefore unclear. Then again, he doesn't necessarily need to be "from" one of them, as there are slave-masters and merchants that move around between the slave-markets of all three cities to conduct trade. </li> <li>The large ship which the three ambassadors from the slaver-alliance arrive at Meereen in displays on its sails the symbol of a <a href="/wiki/Harpy" title="Harpy">Harpy</a> clasping chains-and-manacles in its talons - which is specifically the symbol of <a href="/wiki/Astapor" title="Astapor">Astapor</a>. This specific design was previously used on-screen at Astapor in Season 3. In the novels the different cities actually use slightly different variants of the harpy symbol. The symbol of the old <a href="/wiki/Ghiscari_Empire" title="Ghiscari Empire">Ghiscari Empire</a>, which originally founded all three cities as colonies, was of a harpy grasping thunderbolts in its talons. As for the empire's present-day descendants, Astapor uses a harpy with chains and open manacles in its talons, Yunkai's harpy holds a whip and open slave collar, while Meereen's harpy holds nothing. Only the Astapori harpy has explicitly appeared on banners (or sails) so far in the TV series: it is unclear if it is meant to be the <i>only</i> symbol of the slave-masters in the TV continuity, with no variation between the three cities, or if this ship simply happens to be from Astapor. Given that Yezzan outright states that he is there as a representative of the reconstituted slave-masters of Astapor, it is entirely plausible that it is simply an Astapori ship. </li> <li>Razdal represents Yunkai, and Yezzan says he represents Astapor, but the identity of the third slaver ambassador (who does have speaking lines) is not directly stated. By simply process of elimination he must be from <a href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a>, given that last episode Varys discovered that the foreign cities funding the <a href="/wiki/Sons_of_the_Harpy" title="Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</a> are Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis. On closer inspection, however, there is another hint: this ambassador's costume style matches what was seen in Volantis when it first appeared back in Season 5 (see "<a href="/wiki/Costumes:_Essos#Free_Cities" title="Costumes: Essos">Costumes: Essos - Free Cities</a>"). <ul> <li>The name given for the third envoy in promotional images was "<a href="/wiki/Belicho_Paenymion" title="Belicho Paenymion">Belicho Paenymion</a>," which is itself a combination of different Volantene names from the books. </li> <li>Ironically, Volantis doesn't actually <i>have</i> its own unique costume style, out-of-universe. During production on Season 5, the few scenes taking place in Volantis were only in one episode and squeezed in very much at the last minute - after the budget and time for making entirely new sets and costumes had completely been spent on other new locations which appear much more prominently, such as <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a>. Necessity being the mother of invention, however, the production team was still determined to make functional sets and costumes for the brief scenes set in Volantis - by quickly repurposing and modifying pre-existing sets and costumes (in the industry, this is sometimes known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitbashing" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Kitbashing">kitbashing</a>"). In the Season 5 Blu-ray commentary, costume designer <a href="/wiki/Michele_Clapton" title="Michele Clapton">Michele Clapton</a> explains the process and that ultimately she was very proud of how it turned out and how much work her team put in with limited resources. The cast and crew also had fun trying to guess which bits and pieces of the Volantis set dressing were from what other parts of the TV show. For specifically the <i>costumes</i> of Volantis, many of them were actually costumes previously used in <a href="/wiki/The_Vale_of_Arryn" title="The Vale of Arryn">the Vale of Arryn</a>, with some slight alterations, and intermixed with other pre-existing costumes from Slaver's Bay (see "<a href="/wiki/Costumes:_The_Seven_Kingdoms#The_Vale_of_Arryn" title="Costumes: The Seven Kingdoms">Costumes: The Seven Kingdoms - The Vale of Arryn</a>"). Notice that the Volantene envoy's costume is the same style that the characters in Littlefinger's scene from this episode are also wearing, just with some more jewelry and a few pieces changed up. Given the increased budget for Season 6, compared to previous time constraints, it is unclear why the costume department didn't invent a new Volantene style from scratch. Then again, Clapton left the TV series after Season 5 and was replaced this season by <a href="/wiki/April_Ferry" title="April Ferry">April Ferry</a> as head costume designer: it is possible that Ferry was simply trying to be accurate to the "previously established" Volantene look from Season 5 when she designed the costume of this envoy, not realizing that the "Volantene style" in Season 5 was simply a kitbash of the Vale and Meereen. </li> </ul> </li> <li>The description of the layout of <a href="/wiki/Vaes_Dothrak" title="Vaes Dothrak">Vaes Dothrak</a> which Jorah gives directly matches the novels: the main road leading through the Horse Gate (with the large horse statues) is called the Godsway (because it is lined with the broken idols of the gods of peoples the Dothraki have conquered), which separates the Western Market and the Eastern Market. Daenerys visited the markets back in Season 1 "<a href="/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die" title="You Win or You Die">You Win or You Die</a>". The Dothraki are not merchants themselves and look down on trade, so the merchants in the two markets are actually foreigners - they don't come to trade with the Dothraki, but for caravans from the west and east to trade with <i>each other</i> (avoiding the heavy taxes that <a href="/wiki/Qarth" title="Qarth">Qarth</a> exacts on sea shipping). Notice that Jorah specifically says they will claim they are from the <i>Western</i> Market: the Western Market is run by merchants from the west, i.e. the <a href="/wiki/Free_Cities" title="Free Cities">Free Cities</a>, but the Eastern Market is run by peoples from the Further East, such as <a href="/wiki/Yi_Ti" title="Yi Ti">Yi Ti</a> (in fact, the Yi Tish merchants that Daenerys observes in Vaes Dothrak are the only time in the current novels that any Yi Tish characters have directly appear in the narrative). People from Yi Ti are East Asian in appearance - Martin has stated that it is loosely this fantasy-world's analogue of Imperial China. Thus Jorah says they will claim they are merchants from specifically the Western Market because they can't plausibly be from the Eastern Market, as they obviously don't look Yi Tish. </li> <li>In the novels, Vaes Dothraki is described as a city of tents, with a handful of permanent wooden structures (such as the Temple of the <i>dosh khaleen</i>). It generally had this appearance when it was introduced in Season 1. The alleys that Jorah and Daario make their way through in this episode, however, are formed by more permanent buildings of mud brick. </li> <li>Daario remarks on a Dothraki couple having sex in public at a feast - as previously explained, the Dothraki think it is silly to consider the naked body shameful, and because entire <i>khalasars</i> are on the move together they don't really consider sex to be something that needs to be hidden away in private. <ul><li>Both the novels and the TV series in Season 1 made it a point that the Dothraki usually prefer to have rear-entry position (Doggystyle) sex, yet the Dothraki man and woman in this episode are clearly having sex in the Suspended Congress position. </li></ul> </li> <li>Some of the assembled Dothraki <i>khals</i> decorate themselves with bodypaint of different colors - Rhalko uses brown stripes, another uses black, etc. Khal <a href="/wiki/Drogo" title="Drogo">Drogo</a> used blue paint. The production team came up with the idea that the Dothraki decorate themselves with various paints made from crushed rocks, and Drogo used blue because it is the most expensive. Different <i>khalasars</i>, however, use different colors to distinguish themselves, i.e. Khal <a href="/wiki/Jhaqo" title="Jhaqo">Jhaqo</a>'s horse seen in Season 2's "<a href="/wiki/The_Night_Lands" title="The Night Lands">The Night Lands</a>" used red paint stripes. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/George_R.R._Martin" title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a> himself clarified that in the novels, <b><a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> is <i>not</i> "immune to fire" under normal circumstances.</b> The hatching of her dragons from Khal Drogo's funeral pyre was very much a one-time, magical event - in part due to the rule of <a href="/wiki/Blood_magic" title="Blood magic">Blood magic</a> that only life can pay for life (she needed to burn <a href="/wiki/Mirri_Maz_Duur" title="Mirri Maz Duur">Mirri Maz Duur</a> alive on the funeral pyre as a sacrifice to give the dragons life).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> The showrunners in the Inside the Episode featurette seem to believe Daenerys is "fireproof" all the time - Daenerys herself isn't certain of this in the novels, and doesn't exactly try to test it again by jumping into another raging funeral pyre. On the other hand, the nature of her relationship with fire <i>is</i> mysterious and ambiguous in the novels - and just because she was magically/miraculously unburned <i>once</i> doesn't prevent another miraculous event from happening a <i>second</i> time for her. For all anyone really knows, in the next unpublished novel she might indeed miraculously survive a fire unburned once again. <ul><li>As when Daenerys emerged from the fire unburned in "<a href="/wiki/Fire_and_Blood" title="Fire and Blood">Fire and Blood</a>", Daenerys's hair remains unburned. In the novels, her hair was burned off, and took months to grow back. Practically, it looks much more dramatic if Dany keeps her signature hair, so the team apparently decided to let that detail slide. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Emilia_Clarke" title="Emilia Clarke">Emilia Clarke</a> confirmed that she actually appears nude in the final scene, without a body double, having not done a nude scene since <a href="/wiki/Season_3" title="Season 3">Season 3</a>. The lighting of the shot doesn't exactly match the background, which might lead to the assumption that they digitally added her head onto a body double (as was done with Cersei in the Season 5 finale). Actually, the reason the lighting is slightly mismatched is because Clarke filmed the closeup nude scenes on a closed set - not the large on-location set in Spain with hundreds of extras in the crowd (and also, of course, because she couldn't actually be standing unburned in the middle of a raging fire). In post-production the closeup shots of her entire body were then digitally inserted into the larger set.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Sackheim" title="Daniel Sackheim">Daniel Sackheim</a> directed both this episode and the preceding one, which began by showing the immediate result of <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a>'s resurrection as he rises up from the table at <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a>. In the "Behind the Thrones" featurette for this episode, Sackheim explained that he wanted Jon's scene in the preceding episode and Daenerys's closing scene in this episode to parallel each other: both of them are symbolically being "reborn", and thus both of them are naked to parallel being born as an infant. All of Daenerys's clothes were burned away and she was symbolically reborn in the flames, while Jon <i>literally</i> returned to life, his body stripped naked so Melisandre could clean all of the blood away. While the scenes parallel each other Sackheim also intended a contrast: Jon's "rebirth" happens in the frozen north at the Wall in a room so cold his breath is visible, while Daenerys's "rebirth" is from a raging inferno - i.e. Jon is reborn amid "<b>ice</b>" and Daenerys is reborn amid "<b>fire</b>", as in the title of the <i><a href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novel series which the TV series adapts. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Osha" title="Osha">Osha</a> hasn't returned with <a href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon Stark</a> yet in the novels, and it is doubtful that she will be killed by Ramsay Bolton - or at least, Rickon's capture is a condensation, so it seems unlikely she will die in this specific manner, though she might still die fighting Bolton forces. In the books, Osha took Rickon to the island of <a href="/wiki/Skagos" title="Skagos">Skagos</a> off the east coast of the North - a semi-independent isle only nominally part of the North, considered to practically be wildlings themselves, feared as savage raiders and rumored cannibals. So far, they haven't returned, though in his last chapter in the most recent novel <a href="/wiki/Davos_Seaworth" title="Davos Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a> learns that Rickon and Osha are hiding there, and he intends to retrieve them. Osha's death scene does flow logically for the situation - as Ramsay says, Theon would have told him everything about the Stark boys' escape under torture, so he'd know that Osha was specifically trying to seduce him to kill him. <ul><li>That being said, George R.R. Martin pointed out that even in Season 1, "Osha" in the TV series was very different from "Osha" in the novels (who is older, more stoic, and not as sarcastic). In fact, TV-Osha was one of the very rare cases in which Martin said that (from Season 1) he actually enjoyed the TV version better than the minor character Osha is in the novels - in no small part due to the strength of <a href="/wiki/Natalia_Tena" title="Natalia Tena">Natalia Tena</a>'s performance. This is why they gave her more screentime in Season 2; and why she was even brought back for Season 3 (in the novels, Osha leaves Bran right after escaping Winterfell, but the TV version kept her around until they arrived at the Wall). Thus while Osha's death may be an "invention" of the TV series, most of "TV-Osha" was itself an invention of the TV series - she wasn't this prominent of a character in the novels to begin with. </li></ul> </li> <li>When Ramsay asks Osha if the Bolton sigil and the idea of flaying frightens her, she counters by asking if he eats his victims as well, a question which seems to actually take him aback. Osha is most likely referring to the <a href="/wiki/Thenns" title="Thenns">Thenns</a> and their cannibalistic tendencies. <ul><li>It's also possible that this is an oblique reference to Osha's storyline in the novels: rather than Last Hearth, she took Rickon to <a href="/wiki/Skagos" title="Skagos">Skagos</a>. The novels hint that she may have been there before, and the inhabitants of Skagos are rumored to also be cannibals. </li></ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="The_Bastard_Letter" section="17">The Bastard Letter</h3> <ul><li>The episode introduces the notorious "Bastard letter" that Jon receives from Ramsay near the end of the fifth novel, in which Jon's reaction to it is actually what leads to the mutiny against him. <ul> <li>In the show, no doubt is introduced that Ramsay wrote the letter, for its contents are consistent with the previous scenes. In the book, however, there are several anomalies about it - the most conspicuous is that no piece of skin is enclosed, like most of Ramsay's letters - which led to fan speculations that it was not Ramsay who wrote it. </li> <li>A line from Ramsay's letter was spoken by <a href="/wiki/Iwan_Rheon" title="Iwan Rheon">Iwan Rheon</a> in one of the first teasers for the sixth season, "<i>Winterfell is mine. Come and see."</i> Though in the letter, the line is "<i>Winterfell is mine, <b>bastard</b>. Come and see.</i>", the "bastard" was omitted to hide the spoiler that Ramsay was saying it to Jon Snow, who at the time was believed dead. It <i>did</i>, however, serve as a spoiler regarding Roose Bolton, who would have to be dead in order for Ramsay to claim that Winterfell was his and not Roose's. </li> </ul> </li></ul> <dl><dd> <i>For full information see the main article on the "<a href="/wiki/Bastard_letter" title="Bastard letter">Bastard letter</a>"</i> </dd></dl> <h2 id="In_the_books" section="18"> In the books </h2> <ul> <li> The episode is adapted from the following chapter of <i>A Feast for Crows</i>: <ul><li> Chapter 41, Alayne II: Petyr Baelish reveals his intentions to claim Winterfell. </li></ul> </li> <li> The episode is adapted from the following chapters of <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>: <ul> <li> Chapter 36, Daenerys VI: Daenerys is informed about the Yunkai's terms for peace. </li> <li> Chapter 50, Daenerys VIII: The Yunkai'i lords are welcomed in Meereen and fragile peace is achieved. </li> <li> Chapter 62, The Sacrifice: Having fled Winterfell and Ramsay's control, Theon is reunited with his sister. </li> <li> Chapter 69, Jon XIII: Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay, who demands his bride back, and Jon instead decides to challenge Ramsay. </li> </ul> </li> <li> The episode is adapted from the following chapter of <i>The Winds of Winter</i>: <ul><li> Theon I: <a href="/wiki/Jeyne_Poole" title="Jeyne Poole">Ramsay's bride</a> is sent to Castle Black. </li></ul> </li> </ul> <ul><li>The remaining material appears to be based on what will come in the sixth novel, <i>The Winds of Winter</i>, particularly the storylines of King's Landing and the Faith, Daenerys getting control of the Dothraki khalasars, and loosely Petyr rallying the Knights of the Vale as well. </li></ul> <h2 id="Memorable_Quotes" section="19">Memorable Quotes</h2> <p><b><a href="/wiki/Eddison_Tollett" title="Eddison Tollett">Eddison Tollett</a></b>: "I was with you at Hardhome.
