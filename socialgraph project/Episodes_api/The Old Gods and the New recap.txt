Bran wonders why Theon has attacked them and Theon asserts his intention to seize the castle. Bran reminds Theon that he left to fight for <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a>.

Theon tells Bran to think carefully about his choice of words and gets up to leave. Bran stops him by asking if he hated the Starks the whole time that he lived with them.

Dagmer and Theon’s men maintain order among their prisoners. Bran says that he has yielded Winterfell, and Theon instructs him to speak louder and refer to him as a prince. Bran repeats it as instructed, and Theon takes over. He says that the people all know him, and Farlen interrupts to insult Theon. Bran warns Farlen to keep silent. Theon tells Farlen to listen to Bran, because the young lord has more sense than the kennel master. Bran tells his people to do as Theon commands. Theon tells the assembly that his father has declared himself <a href="/wiki/King_of_the_Iron_Islands" title="King of the Iron Islands">King of the Iron Islands</a> by donning the ancient crown of salt and rock. He says that Balon also claims <a href="/wiki/The_North" title="The North">the North</a> by right of conquest and that they are now King Balon’s subjects. Farlen objects, asserting his loyalty to <a href="/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a> and begins to criticize Theon’s strategy. He is clubbed on the back of the head by one of Theon’s men and falls to the ground. Palla helps Farlen up as Theon tells the smallfolk that he will treat them well if they serve him as loyally as they did <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>. He warns that he will make any traitors regret betraying him. </p> <p>Theon instructs Luwin to send ravens to Balon at Pyke and to his sister <a href="/wiki/Yara_Greyjoy" title="Yara Greyjoy">Yara</a> at <a href="/wiki/Deepwood_Motte" title="Deepwood Motte">Deepwood Motte</a> to inform them of his victory.

She says that she was brought to Winterfell as a captive and reminds Theon that he was present the day she was taken. He claims to be the one who captured her. She bends the knee and offers to serve Theon. Theon asks how she will serve him and insults her by saying that he needs fighters not kitchen sluts. She says that Robb put her in the kitchens and that she will fight for Theon if he puts a spear in her hands. Theon suspects her of treachery and refuses. He orders her to get up and pushes her aside. She stands by Bran, and he asks her why she is betraying them. She says that his dream has come true; the ocean has reached Winterfell and she does not intend to drown. </p> <p>Theon continues to address the people, but is interrupted by the arrival of <a href="/wiki/Lorren" title="Lorren">Lorren</a> and three men with a captive, Ser <a href="/wiki/Rodrik_Cassel" title="Rodrik Cassel">Rodrik Cassel</a>.

Luwin returns to the courtyard as Lorren gives his explanation. Theon tells Ser Rodrik that it grieves him that they meet as foes. Rodrik counters by saying that it grieves him that Theon has less honor than a whore. Rodrik reminds Theon that he was raised at Winterfell and says that the people are his people. Theon denies the claim, and Rodrik tells him that Robb considered him a brother. Theon says that his brothers are dead and died fighting the Starks. Rodrik retorts that they died in a war that Balon started. Rodrik says that <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Lord Stark</a> raised Theon among his own sons, and Theon angrily asserts that he was never treated as one of them and was a hostage. Theon tells Rodrik that Eddard is dead and that the Seven Kingdoms are at war. Theon again asserts that Winterfell is his. Rodrik says that he should have put a sword in Theon’s belly instead of his hand. Theon says that Rodrik has served faithfully and then begins a threat. Rodrik spits in his face. Theon orders Rodrik imprisoned, but Dagmer counsels that he must die for his actions. Dagmer says that the men will not respect Theon while Rodrik lives. Theon hesitates and then announces the death sentence.  </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":4}' data-ref="4"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fd/RodrickBeforeDeath.png/revision/latest?cb=20160720012608"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20797%20498'%2F%3E" alt="RodrickBeforeDeath.png" width="797" height="498"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fd/RodrickBeforeDeath.png/revision/latest?cb=20160720012608" alt="RodrickBeforeDeath.png" width="797" height="498"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>The execution of Ser <a href="/wiki/Rodrik_Cassel" title="Rodrik Cassel">Rodrik Cassel</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Bran reminds Theon that he said that no harm would come to the people if he yielded. Theon counters that Rodrik could not keep his mouth shut. Luwin approaches Theon and advises him not to make a hasty decision. Theon says that Rodrik chose to disrespect him in front of his men. Luwin counsels that Rodrik is worth more alive than dead and says that the Starks will ransom him. Luwin urges Theon to consider his actions. Theon hesitates and then looks at Dagmer who shakes his head. Theon warns the master to address him as Prince Theon or be next. Dagmer motions to <a href="/wiki/Lorren" title="Lorren">Lorren</a>, who drags Rodrik to the executioner's block, as Dagmer draws his sword. Bran, Rickon, and the people cry out to Theon to have mercy. Rodrik stares defiantly at Theon and says that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, before calling him a coward. Theon pushes Dagmer aside and draws his own weapon. Bran calls out for Theon to stop, and Theon retorts that Bran no longer gives commands. Bran begs Theon to stop, and Rodrik tells Bran to hush, saying that he is going to see Bran’s father. Theon asks Rodrik if he has any last words, and Rodrik says “<i>Gods help you Theon Greyjoy, now you are truly lost</i>.” Theon swings the sword down on Rodrik’s neck, but his first blow does not kill him. Theon swings a further three times to the horror of the onlookers. He has to kick Rodrik’s head to finally sever it from his body. Theon looks around at his captives, realizing what he has done and how they all hate him. </p> <h2 id="Scene_4" section="4">Scene 4</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/Ranging_206.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120430080948"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20780%20430'%2F%3E" alt="Ranging 206.jpg" width="780" height="430"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/b8/Ranging_206.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120430080948" alt="Ranging 206.jpg" width="780" height="430"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption><a href="/wiki/Qhorin_Halfhand" title="Qhorin Halfhand" class="mw-redirect">Qhorin Halfhand</a>'s rangers in the <a href="/wiki/Skirling_Pass" title="Skirling Pass">Skirling Pass</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Qhorin_Halfhand" title="Qhorin Halfhand" class="mw-redirect">Qhorin Halfhand</a> leads his scouting party into the <a href="/wiki/Skirling_Pass" title="Skirling Pass">Skirling Pass</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> calls to his direwolf <a href="/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">Ghost</a> to stay close to them but is ignored.

Qhorin says that wild creatures cannot be trusted and Jon says that Ghost is different. Qhorin asserts that wild creatures have their own unknowable rules and reasons. Qhorin warns that the wildlings they are looking for are nocturnal hunters. Jon points out that Qhorin is contradicting his assertion that you can’t know a wild thing. Qhorin retorts that he meant that Jon can’t. Qhorin expands that the wildlings hide in caves while the sun is up and then do their killing while it is dark. Jon suggests that they do the same and Qhorin counters that they do not know the terrain well enough, saying that he has lost good men to hidden crevasses. Jon says that his father always told him that he was of the North and Qhorin laughs at him. Jon says that he was not joking and Qhorin asks him to look around at the icy terrain and consider if it is anything like his home. Qhorin warns that the land itself will kill you if you start to think that you know it. He asks if Jon understands and Jon nods. Qhorin tells Jon that he does not understand. Qhorin says that they are at war and have always been at war. He says that their war will never end because they are not fighting an enemy but fighting the North, which is not going anywhere. </p> <p>Qhorin tells Jon that the <a href="/wiki/Night%E2%80%99s_Watch" title="Night’s Watch" class="mw-redirect">Night’s Watch</a> has given him a great gift and that he can reciprocate by giving his life. Jon says that he would gladly give his life for the Watch. Qhorin stops and grabs Jon, telling him that he does not want him to die gladly. He says that he wants him to curse and fight to his last heart beat. Qhorin says that Jon’s death will be a gift to the people south of the wall but that they will never know of his actions or his name. Qhorin again asks if Jon understands him and Jon again answers affirmatively. Qhorin says that Jon is even dumber than he looks and dismisses what he has said as words intended to make them feel that they have a purpose. Qhorin urges Jon onwards saying that they must find their quarry before night falls and the tables are turned. </p> <h2 id="Scene_5" section="5">Scene 5</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":6}' data-ref="6"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f5/Tywin_berates_Lorch.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160805023705"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Tywin berates Lorch.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/f5/Tywin_berates_Lorch.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160805023705" alt="Tywin berates Lorch.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Lord <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a> berating Ser <a href="/wiki/Amory_Lorch" title="Amory Lorch">Amory Lorch</a> for his illiteracy.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a> hosts another war council in his chambers at <a href="/wiki/Harrenhal" title="Harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>. <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a> continues to serve incognito as his cupbearer. Tywin asks Ser <a href="/wiki/Amory_Lorch" title="Amory Lorch">Amory Lorch</a> if he is able to read and the knight does not answer. Tywin reveals that Ser Amory has sent a letter detailing their troop movements to Lord Marlin of <a href="/wiki/House_Dormund" title="House Dormund">House Dormund</a> instead of Lord <a href="/wiki/Damon_Marbrand" title="Damon Marbrand">Damon</a> of <a href="/wiki/House_Marbrand" title="House Marbrand">House Marbrand</a>. Ser Amory apologizes and Tywin orders Arya to fetch “<a href="/wiki/The_History_of_the_Greater_and_the_Lesser_Houses" title="The History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses">The History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses</a>.” Arya picks up the book while Tywin is still describing it and he realizes that she can read. Tywin decries Amory as a worse reader than a cupbearer. Tywin opens the book to the page for House Dormund and asks Amory to read who they owe allegiance to. Amory is hesitant and Tywin shouts that they are vassals of House Stark of Winterfell, their enemies and the captors of his son <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>. Tywin says that he had judged that Amory might be useful for more than brutalizing peasants and that he overestimated. Tywin warns Amory not to endanger Jaime’s life again and dismisses him. </p> <p>Tywin instructs Arya to clear the book away. He sarcastically says that she should devise their next battle plan.

Tywin dismisses his remaining bannermen while Arya freezes in fear of recognition. Tywin orders her to clear the table and she complies. Tywin offers wine and Arya goes to serve it. Tywin asks for news from the capital and Petyr explains that he has come from <a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</a>’s camp. Tywin jokes about the duration of Renly’s reign and repeats the rumor that he was murdered by a woman. Arya pours wine, carefully keeping out of Petyr’s vision. Petyr says that there have been talk of <a href="/wiki/Shadow" title="Shadow">other forces</a> at work and Tywin dismissively says that men love to blame demons when their grand plans fall apart. He motions for Arya to pour him wine and she turns her back to Petyr. Petyr says that he believes that chaos affords transient opportunities. Tywin says that the belief is not original and asks what opportunities he has found. Petyr brings up <a href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a> and their large army. Tywin is impatient and Petyr moves to his point; he says that <a href="/wiki/Loras_Tyrell" title="Loras Tyrell">Loras Tyrell</a> blames <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</a> for Renly’s death and wants revenge while Margaery wants to be queen. Tywin is already aware of Margaery’s ambition. Tywin reminds Petyr that House Tyrell are traitors to the Iron Throne and Petyr says that they might be able to punish them once Stannis and Robb have been defeated. Tywin orders Arya to serve more wine to Petyr. Petyr offers to broker an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell. Tywin asserts that the Tyrell host has returned to <a href="/wiki/Highgarden" title="Highgarden">Highgarden</a>. Arya spills wine on Petyr’s hand and apologizes. He stares at her as he says that it was only wine. Tywin draws Petyr’s attention back to him when he asks if he would ride there himself.

She says that if he they were feeling kind they would grant him a quick death. Qhorin pragmatically details the reasons that Ygritte must die and draws his sword. Jon says that he will kill her himself. Qhorin leads the rest of his men away and tells Jon to meet them at the summit, warning him to be quick because they are deep in wildling territory. </p> <p>Ygritte realizes that Jon has never killed a woman before.
