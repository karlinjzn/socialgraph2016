To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb, so Catelyn Stark enters to negotiate their crossing the river.  <p>Though held by <a href="/wiki/House_Frey" title="House Frey">House Frey</a>, bannermen to <a href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Hoster_Tully" title="Hoster Tully">father</a>, Lord <a href="/wiki/Walder_Frey" title="Walder Frey">Walder Frey</a> has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the Tully's army has been defeated and <a href="/wiki/Riverrun" title="Riverrun">Riverrun</a> is held by the Lannisters, he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between Catelyn and Walder, they strike a deal: the Freys will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both Robb and <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a> must each marry one of Walder's own children. Robb agrees, though noting that Arya won't like it. Robb must also take <a href="/wiki/Olyvar_Frey" title="Olyvar Frey">Olyvar Frey</a> as a squire. </p> <p>The <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" title="House Lannister">Lannister</a> armies prepare for battle. <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin</a> tells his son <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</a> that he means to use the <a href="/wiki/Hill_tribes" title="Hill tribes">hill tribe</a> forces to give them an edge against the <a href="/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">Stark</a> army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard. Tyrion angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> has found him, as per instruction, a <a href="/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">whore</a> named <a href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a>. Tyrion takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, Bronn goes off to find a whore for himself. </p> <p>Tyrion, Bronn, and Shae play a drinking game the night before the battle. Tyrion makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). Tyrion guesses that Shae's mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born; however he is wrong on each guess. Tyrion cannot read Shae's personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When Shae starts to question Tyrion, <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married. Reluctantly, Tyrion explains that when he was very young, he and <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime</a> were out riding near <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While Jaime chased the bandits off, Tyrion comforted the girl, whose name was <a href="/wiki/Tysha" title="Tysha">Tysha</a>. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that Tyrion felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with Tyrion, the first time he was ever with a woman. Tyrion fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret. </p> However, two weeks later his father, Tywin, found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. Tywin forced Jaime to reveal the truth: the girl was a <a href="/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostitute</a>. Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. Tywin then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while Tyrion was forced to watch. Shae points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with Tyrion, Bronn leaves the tent.<figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7b/Tyrion_1x09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110609002421"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20500%20281'%2F%3E" alt="Tyrion 1x09.jpg" width="500" height="281"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7b/Tyrion_1x09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110609002421" alt="Tyrion 1x09.jpg" width="500" height="281"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption><a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> leads the <a href="/wiki/Hill_tribes" title="Hill tribes">hill tribes</a> into battle.</figcaption></figure>The next morning the Lannister army finds that the Starks have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle.

When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle, but it was a feint.

The High Septon, nevertheless, is still present in the scene as Ned mentions him. It was actually George R.R.

In addition, the original novel has Tyrion telling his story of being set up with a whore to Bronn shortly after leaving the Eyrie. Cogman later stated that the reason for this was to keep the battle off-screen, while Tyrion was unconscious: they had originally planned to include the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Green_Fork" title="Battle of the Green Fork">Battle of the Green Fork</a> on-screen (as in the novels) and even storyboarded it out - but towards the end of filming they simply ran out of budget and it became obvious that they had no realistic hope of including it. The massive success of Season 1 did lead to a larger budget in later seasons, including large on-screen battles, which Cogman hoped made up for their comparatively bare budget early on.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Cogman" title="Bryan Cogman">Bryan Cogman</a> stated in his Twitter account that originally, the showrunners never intended to include the scene in which Tyrion explains his backstory with <a href="/wiki/Tysha" title="Tysha">Tysha</a> in Season 1 - keeping in mind that at the time, they thought they would be lucky to get renewed for a second season, so they didn't want to waste time introducing many plot elements that would only pay off in the future if they had no guarantee they'd even get another season. At the time, they did plan on giving the backstory about Tysha in Season 2, in the event that the show was renewed. As it happened, because the runtime of Season 1 came up short, they realized it was a great scene to put back in (also because it was a small, intimate scene only involving a few characters and wouldn't take much more time to set up). Cogman is also convinced that Dinklage's emotional performance in this Tysha backstory scene is what won him his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Season 1.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> </li> <li>Cogman stated that the fight between Jorah Mormont and Qotho was originally conceived as the much bigger fight it is in the novels, in which Rakharo would join Jorah in fighting all three of Drogo's bloodriders. Ultimately it had to be cut down due to time constraints - though Cogman still thinks that the more personal one-on-one fight between Jorah and Qotho in the final version still worked out great.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> </li> <li>Cogman said that the drinking game between Tyrion, Shae, and Bronn was added during the wave of rewrites late in production in Season 1, when they realized that the season was a bit short so they added in several character-building dialogue scenes that required little budget - and which in hindsight the writers felt didn't merely help fill out the run time but greatly added to characterization.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> </li> </ul> <h2 id="In_the_books" section="13">In the books</h2> <dl><dd> <i>See: <a href="/wiki/Differences_between_books_and_TV_series_-_Season_1#Baelor" title="Differences between books and TV series - Season 1">Differences between books and TV series - Season 1#Baelor</a> </i> </dd></dl> <ul><li> The episode is adapted from the following chapters of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>: <ul> <li> Chapter 58, Eddard XV. </li> <li> Chapter 59, Catelyn IX. </li> <li> Chapter 60, Jon VIII. </li> <li> Chapter 62, Tyrion VIII. </li> <li> Chapter 63, Catelyn X. </li> <li> Chapter 64, Daenerys VIII. </li> <li> Chapter 65, Arya V. </li> </ul> </li></ul> <h2 id="Memorable_quotes" section="14">Memorable quotes</h2> <p><b><a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a></b>: "You think my life is some precious thing to me?
