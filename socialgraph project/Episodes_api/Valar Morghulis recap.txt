Pycelle reports that <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> suffered a stunning defeat at the hand of Tyrion’s father, <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>. Tyrion asks where he is and Pycelle gleefully informs him that the cramped room comprises his new chambers. He adds that Tyrion does not really need much room. Pycelle informs Tyrion that he is no longer Hand of the King and then walks to the door. Pycelle turns and shows Tyrion a coin before tossing it at him.

The hand’s badge is presented to Tywin and he curtly thanks Joffrey before turning his horse and riding out. </p> <p>Joffrey calls Lord <a href="/wiki/Petyr_Baelish" title="Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</a> forward.

Joffrey smiles at his mother Queen Regent <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> as Margaery speaks. He responds by telling Margaery that he has heard tales of her beauty and grace but that they do not do her justice. Joffrey says that it would be an honor to return her love but points out that he is promised to another. He asserts that a king must keep his word. <p>Cersei intervenes theatrically to assert that the <a href="/wiki/Small_council" title="Small council" class="mw-redirect">small council</a> have agreed that it would be improper for Joffrey to wed Sansa.

He offers to help Sansa to return home for Catelyn’s sake. Sansa hesitates and then asserts that King’s Landing is her home.

He says that she must have had an awful childhood, guessing that she was a foot taller than all of the boys she grew up with. He assumes that she was laughed at and bullied because of her size. He says that some boys like a challenge and that one or two must have tried to have sex with her. Brienne admits that some tried, shoving Jaime forwards. Jaime wonders if Brienne wished that one of them had succeeded in overpowering her and was disappointed that none of them were strong enough. Jaime says that he is strong enough. Brienne tells him that she is not interested. Jaime says that she must be and asserts that she would love to know what it feels like to be a woman. </p> <p>Brienne is distracted by the hanging corpses of three women. Jaime looks up at them and reads the sign hung around their necks “they lay with lions.” Jaime concludes that they were tavern girls who served the soldiers of his father, Lord Tywin Lannister. He tells Brienne that they earned their deaths by giving up a kiss and a feel and calls the hangings the glorious work of the northern freedom fighters. He asks if it makes Brienne proud to serve House Stark. Brienne counters that she serves Lady Catelyn rather than House Stark. Jaime invites her to tell herself that when she pictures the swinging bodies in her dreams. </p> <p>Brienne shoves him to one side and ties him to a tree.

The lead soldier, Tom,<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> stops her to ask who she fights for. She says that she serves House Stark. One of the soldiers asks why Jaime is a prisoner. He claims to have stolen a pig, feigning the accent of the smallfolk. The soldier asks Brienne where she is taking him and she claims to be headed to Riverrun because the pig belonged to House Tully. Tom wonders why she does not just kill Jaime. Jaime protests while she says that she does not give orders and that it must have seemed important to someone. Tom asks how important it could be if they sent her as the escort. Brienne does not respond and he says she can have it her way. </p> <p>One of the soldiers asks if he knows Jaime. Jaime claims to come from <a href="/wiki/Ashemark" title="Ashemark">Ashemark</a> and asks if he has been there. The soldier asks if Jaime has been to the river market at <a href="/wiki/Salt_Rock" title="Salt Rock">Salt Rock</a> and Jaime wonders if it is near Ashemark then claims that he has never been there. Tom asks Brienne what she thinks of the hanged women. Brienne says that she hopes that they were given quick deaths. He responds that two of them were. The soldier that recognized Jaime realizes who he is and tells his companions. Jaime and Brienne attempt to keep up their pretense. Tom questions how his colleague knows Jaime. The soldier says that he fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Whispering_Wood" title="Battle of the Whispering Wood">Battle of the Whispering Wood</a> and saw Jaime hauled before King <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> after he was captured. </p> <p>Tom challenges Brienne and Jaime to give Jaime’s name simultaneously at the count of three. One of the soldiers circles behind them. Brienne shoves Jaime aside and draws her weapons. She smashes the man behind her in the face with the hilt of her sword and then slices the throat of the man that recognized Jaime with her dagger before he can draw his own blade. She cuts at Tom who falls on his back to avoid her sword. The soldier she hit grabs her shoulder, and she spins around, slicing across him with both her blades. She approaches Tom slowly as he lies prone. She says “two quick deaths” and then slowly pushes her sword through his crotch. Jaime is stunned by her proficiency. He points out that she has killed Stark men. She counters that she has already told him that she serves Lady Catelyn only. She states that she will take him to King’s Landing as promised. She tells him to stay and cuts down the hanged bodies. Jaime flinches as they collapse to the ground. </p> <h2 id="Scene_5" section="5">Scene 5</h2> <p>King <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> visits his mother <a href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</a> in her tent to discuss his plan to break his betrothal to <a href="/wiki/House_Frey" title="House Frey">House Frey</a> to marry <a href="/wiki/Talisa_Maegyr" title="Talisa Maegyr" class="mw-redirect">Talisa Maegyr</a>.

Robb asserts that he loves Talisa. Catelyn asks if that is really important and he replies that it is to him. Catelyn tells him that his father, <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>, did not love her when they were first married. She says that they hardly knew one another and that they built their love for one another slowly over time for the good of their family. She says that working on a marriage is not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but is ultimately stronger. Robb bristles as she tells him that it lasts longer. He asks if he can expect to slowly build a loving relationship with one of Walder Frey’s daughters. Catelyn asks why not, wondering if he thinks his wife will not be beautiful or exotic and exciting like Talisa. Robb says that Catelyn is arguing only because she made the arrangement with Lord Frey. Catelyn reminds Robb that he agreed to the terms and gave his word. Catelyn warns Robb that if he treats his oaths recklessly then his people will do the same. Catelyn begins to say that Robb’s father lived his life for honor. Robb counters that his father is dead and Catelyn has no right to call anyone reckless. He walks out, leaving Catelyn with her guards. </p> <h2 id="Scene_6" section="6">Scene 6</h2> <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> glowers over the Painted Table at <a href="/wiki/Dragonstone" title="Dragonstone" class="mw-redirect">Dragonstone</a>.

His nerves are frayed by the constant sounding of a horn outside the castle walls; <a href="/wiki/Ramsay_Snow" title="Ramsay Snow" class="mw-redirect">Ramsay Snow</a> has besieged Winterfell as ordered by King Robb Stark. Theon vows to kill the horn blower before he falls to the arrows and spears of the northmen. Maester Luwin says that the attackers want Theon to know that he is surrounded. Theon says that he already knows that he has been surrounded because he stood on the battlements and saw the 500 men around his walls. Luwin says that they want to stop him from sleeping to sap his spirit. Theon interrupts to sarcastically thank Luwin for his wise counsel about siege tactics. Theon asks if there has been word from his father, <a href="/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy" title="Balon Greyjoy">Balon Greyjoy</a> and Luwin says no. Theon orders him to send more ravens and Luwin reminds Theon that he had all of the ravens killed. </p> <p>Theon begins to reminisce about the first time he saw Winterfell but is interrupted by another horn blast. He starts over and says that he believed that castle looked like it had been present for thousands of years and would be standing thousands of years after he died. The imposing castle made him feel that it was inevitable that <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a> won the <a href="/wiki/Greyjoy_Rebellion" title="Greyjoy Rebellion">Greyjoy Rebellion</a> and killed his brothers. Luwin says that Eddard went out of his way to make Theon feel at home at Winterfell. Theon sarcastically agrees that his captors were very kind to him and notes that all the people of Winterfell love reminding him of that. He rhetorically asks if Luwin knows what it is like to constantly be told how lucky you are to be someone’s prisoner and how much you owe them. He tearfully mentions the reaction he received when he returned home to his real father but is again interrupted by the horn blower. He stands and vows again to kill the man, this time swearing to all the gods. </p> <p>Luwin asks Theon to listen to him and reminds him that he is bound by oath to serve him as the Lord of Winterfell. Theon sarcastically asks for Luwin’s counsel, calling him a trusted friend. Luwin tells him to run. He says that the tactical situation is hopeless and Theon should wait for night to fall and then flee. Theon says that he has nowhere to run and would never reach the Iron Islands alive and even if he did he would be received as a coward. Theon declines to be the “Greyjoy who ran” and the shame of his family. Luwin says that Theon should not return home and should instead join the Night’s Watch. He advises that a man who has taken the black is beyond reach of the law and absolved of his past deeds. Luwin asserts that is a chance at redemption for Theon. Theon says that he will never reach the wall and would be killed as soon as he stepped outside the gates. Luwin offers to show Theon hidden passageways out of the castle, built so that the Lords of Winterfell could escape if needed. Luwin counsels that the road will be dangerous but that Theon has a chance. Luwin extols the virtues of the Night’s Watch as an ancient honorable order that will offer Theon opportunities. Theon counters that it will give Jon Snow the opportunity to cut his throat. Luwin states that it will give Theon a chance to make amends for what he has done. </p> <p>Theon pauses and says that he has done a lot. He admits that he has done things that he never imagined himself doing. Luwin says that he has known Theon for many years and that he is not the man that he is pretending to be. He puts a hand on Theon’s shoulder as he says “not yet.” Theon says that Luwin may be right but that he has gone too far to pretend to be anything else. </p> <h2 id="Scene_8" section="8">Scene 8</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":11}' data-ref="11"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e5/Theon_2x10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120604085640"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201024%20576'%2F%3E" alt="Theon 2x10.jpg" width="1024" height="576"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e5/Theon_2x10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120604085640" alt="Theon 2x10.jpg" width="1024" height="576"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Theon holding speach for his men.</figcaption></figure>Theon stands before his men in the courtyard of Winterfell.

Theon asserts that every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland and asks if his men agree. <a href="/wiki/Lorren" title="Lorren">Lorren</a> affirms the statement and the others join him.

He says that their war cries will nevertheless echo through eternity and that men will sing about the Battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. He says that every man, woman and child will know who they were and how long they stood. He calls the names of his men “Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren.” He says that future Ironborn warriors will cry out their names as they leap onto the shore at Seagard and Faircastle. The men shout “Aye” in response. Theon says that mothers will name their sons after them. The men shout “Aye” in response. Theon says that girls will think of them while their lovers are inside them. The men shout “Aye” in response. Theon says that man who kills the hornblower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke. The men shout “Aye” in response.

They tell her that they will be with her until time comes to an end. </p> <div class="article-media-gallery gallery" data-component="article-media-gallery" data-attrs='{"ref":0}' data-ref="0"> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="0"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7f/Daenerys_and_dragons_2x10.png/revision/latest?cb=20160804232526"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20800%20474'%2F%3E" alt="Daenerys and dragons 2x10.png" width="800" height="474"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7f/Daenerys_and_dragons_2x10.png/revision/latest?cb=20160804232526" alt="Daenerys and dragons 2x10.png" width="800" height="474"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption><a href="/wiki/Drogon" title="Drogon">Drogon</a> and his brothers burn <a href="/wiki/Pyat_Pree" title="Pyat Pree">Pyat Pree</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="0"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/08/Pyat_Pree_dead.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120604073821"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Pyat Pree dead.jpg" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/08/Pyat_Pree_dead.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120604073821" alt="Pyat Pree dead.jpg" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Pyat Pree's charred corpse.</figcaption></figure> </div> <p>When she is secured in place, the copies disappear and the real Pyat Pree welcomes her to her new home. She replies that her true home is across the sea where her people are waiting. He counters that they will be waiting a long time. She looks back at the trio of tiny dragons behind her and he bends down to share her view. She turns her head back to stare at him defiantly and then speaks the command “Dracarys.” Drogon coughs smoke and Pyat Pree looks at him and then backs away. Daenerys waits and the dragon tries again, this time projecting a jet of flame which sets the warlock’s left arm alight. He flails the flaming limb uselessly. The other dragons join Drogon in breathing fire at the sorcerer. He screams in pain and terror and crumples to the ground, a charred dead husk. Daenerys looks at her children as the magical chains on Drogon crumble to dust with the sorcerer dead. Daenerys turns her head back as the clinking of falling chains fills the room. </p> <h2 id="Scene_21" section="21">Scene 21</h2> <p>Ygritte pushes Jon along in a column of marching wildlings.

Ygritte tells Jon that he might survive the night if he knows what to say. She hits him with Longclaw again and warns him that silence is the wrong choice. Jon warns her to be careful with the sword, needling that she might cut herself. He ducks her next swing and guesses that she has never swung a sword before. He says that she looks like a baby with a rattle. They square off and the Lord of Bones tells them to stop. </p> <p>Qhorin seizes the moment of distraction to act. He head butts the wildling behind him and takes his sword. He then shoves the Lord of Bones off his feet, causing him to drop the leash. He attacks Jon and manages to knock Jon off his feet before he is restrained by the wildlings. Jon calls for him to stop. Qhorin shouts that Jon is a traitor and asks if he is planning to give Mance an invitation to Castle Black. The Lord of Bones calls to his men to let them fight and Ygritte drops Longclaw on the ground next to Jon. Qhorin pulls free of the men holding him and swings at Jon as he picks up the sword. Jon fights defensively, parrying Qhorin’s furious attacks and giving up ground. Qhorin shoves Jon into the circle of wildling surrounding them and they push Jon back towards his assailant. Qhorin mocks Jon’s ability and renews his assault. Jon begins to swing back at Qhorin and ducks under one of his cuts. Qhorin asks Jon if his traitor father taught him the move. Jon attacks in earnest and their blades lock, bringing them face to face. Qhorin suggests that it was Jon’s “whore mother” and then head butts him, knocking him to the ground. Qhorin does not press his advantage and Jon regains his footing. Jon charges back at the older ranger and manages to disarm him. He stabs Qhorin through the chest, bringing them face to face again. Jon wrenches his blade free from his sworn brother and Qhorin uses his last breath to recite part of their oath “We are the watchers on the Wall.” </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":17}' data-ref="17"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/Jon_kills_Qhorin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720032340"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Jon kills Qhorin.jpg" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/Jon_kills_Qhorin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720032340" alt="Jon kills Qhorin.jpg" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Jon kills Quorin.</figcaption></figure><p>Qhorin collapses dead to the ground and Ygritte says that they can tell Mance that Jon is the man who killed Qhorin.
