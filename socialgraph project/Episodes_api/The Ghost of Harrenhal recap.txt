Catelyn beseeches him to reconsider negotiating with Stannis. Renly reminds Catelyn of his brother’s rigidity and refuses to attempt further debate with him. He asks her to take his terms to Robb and says that he sees them as natural allies and hopes that Robb feels the same. He suggests that acting together they could end the war in a fortnight. An unnatural gust parts the tents opening and black smoke rushes inside. Catelyn and Brienne are stunned while Renly watches transfixed in his mirror. The smoke coalesces into a <a href="/wiki/Shadow" title="Shadow">human shape</a> and stabs Renly through the chest. In the mirror its face resembles Stannis. The smoke dissipates and Renly collapses forward.

Lorren approaches Theon and says that he has been reaving and raping since before Theon was born. He says that he has no use for Theon’s ideas on how to do it and that he could do the job himself. Theon says that, if Lorren tries to take his ship, he will hunt him down and hang him as a traitor. </p> <p><a href="/wiki/Yara_Greyjoy" title="Yara Greyjoy">Yara Greyjoy</a> arrives and jokingly cries out that Theon can stop, because they yield.

Theon says that she should hurry, or they might set sail without her. She retorts that her men are loyal enough to wait on deck for a year for her.

Daenerys thanks Irri, calling her friend. Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from <a href="/wiki/Illyrio_Mopatis" title="Illyrio Mopatis">Illyrio Mopatis</a>, saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Khal <a href="/wiki/Drogo" title="Drogo">Drogo</a>. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro’s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro’s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest’s courtesy to Xaro. </p> <h2 id="Scene_16" section="16">Scene 16</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":23}' data-ref="23"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/75/Kovarro1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120602142411"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Kovarro1.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/75/Kovarro1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120602142411" alt="Kovarro1.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Kovarro steals</figcaption></figure><p>Daenerys consorts with the people of Qarth in the gardens of Xaro’s home.

Qhorin cautions that they cannot march on the wildlings or expect to defeat them from their current position. </p> <p>Jeor wonders if he is suggesting that they return to the Wall. Qhorin says that because Mance was once a brother of the Night’s Watch he will have instilled more discipline into the wildlings than they have known before.

Daenerys wonders if he has the same skill with women and he ruefully says that they are much more complicated. He asks what Daenerys wants and she states her ambition to cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Xaro asks why and Daenerys cites her promise to her khalasar. Xaro laughs and wonders if she wants to conquer the seven kingdoms for the Dothraki. She asserts that the Iron Throne is hers by right and that she will take it. Xaro says that she is a conqueror. Daenerys wonders how he obtained his wealth, comparing his success to her ambition. She concludes that he is also a conqueror, albeit one with less ambition. He reveals that he is a self made man and arrived in Qarth with nothing.

Daenerys wonders what is inside and he only laughs enigmatically. She wonders if he plans to give her all of his wealth and what she must do for it. He says that she can have half and that she only needs to marry him. She laughs at the unromantic proposal and he says that he has married once for love but lost his wife.

For the first time fully aware of the political situation overseas, she is eager to seize the opportunity of striking while the Seven Kingdoms are weakened by civil war. Jorah asserts that she will need support from within her Kingdom in order to win her throne. Jorah warns against accepting the reports of Xaro at face value given their brief association. Daenerys says that they must strike now or spend the rest of their lives rotting away at the edge of the world. Jorah warns that rich men always expect a return on their investment and will believe that they own Daenerys if she takes their ships and soldiers. He says that moving carefully is the harder way but the right way. Daenerys reminds him that if she had exercised the caution that he advised outside the gates of Qarth then they would all have died in the Garden of Bones. Jorah cautions not to consider the opportunity that has presented itself as the last she will ever have. Daenerys warns him not to speak to her like a child. Jorah says that he only wants to see Daenerys on the Iron Throne. She asks why and he describes how he sees her. He says that although she denies it she has a gentle heart and he believes she would be a great ruler; feared, respected and loved. He explains that the marriage of capability and a valid claim is so rare that it should not be squandered. He says that he sometimes looks at her and cannot believe she is real. </p> <p>His honest admission of his feelings creates an awkward atmosphere. Daenerys asks for his counsel as her adviser and he says that she should find her own way back. He explains that she needs just a single ship and can win the allies that she needs in Westeros. She wonders how she will find a ship and he answers that he will find it for her saying that it will be a good ship with an honest captain. Daenerys says that she looks forward to meeting him. He bows to her and leaves her alone. </p> <h2 id="Scene_24" section="24">Scene 24</h2> <div class="article-media-gallery gallery" data-component="article-media-gallery" data-attrs='{"ref":0}' data-ref="0"> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="0"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2e/Jaqen_kill_Tickler.png/revision/latest?cb=20160809105423"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="Jaqen_kill_Tickler.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/2e/Jaqen_kill_Tickler.png/revision/latest?cb=20160809105423" alt="Jaqen_kill_Tickler.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Jaqen after the killing of the Tickler.</figcaption></figure><figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="0"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a1/The_Tickler_dead.png/revision/latest?cb=20160829160340"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="The_Tickler_dead.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a1/The_Tickler_dead.png/revision/latest?cb=20160829160340" alt="The_Tickler_dead.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>The Tickler found dead.</figcaption></figure> </div> <p>Arya watches Gendry tempering a newly forged blade in the smithy at Harrenhal.
