Sweating profusely, he opens his eyes. Groggy with blurry vision, he sees <a href="/wiki/Cersei" title="Cersei" class="mw-redirect">Cersei</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a> standing by his bed, looking down at him disapproving and concerned respectively. </p> <p>Lord Eddard apologizes to King Robert for not being able to rise. Cersei interrupts to ask if he knows of the actions of <a href="/wiki/Catelyn" title="Catelyn" class="mw-redirect">Catelyn</a> (abducting <a href="/wiki/Tyrion" title="Tyrion" class="mw-redirect">Tyrion</a>). Eddard quickly informs them, falsely, that Catelyn took Tyrion prisoner on his orders. Robert realizes that Eddard is just saying this to protect her. He says he didn't know she had it in her. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":0}' data-ref="0"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Cersei_and_Robert.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160814015948"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201183%20668'%2F%3E" alt="Cersei and Robert.jpg" width="1183" height="668"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Cersei_and_Robert.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160814015948" alt="Cersei and Robert.jpg" width="1183" height="668"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Cersei and Robert confront an injured Eddard over the abduction of Tyrion.</figcaption></figure><p>Cersei asks how he dared to lay hands on one of her blood. Eddard replies that his position as Hand of the King gives him the authority to do what he must to keep the King's peace. Cersei retorts to that he is no longer Hand, and now he must face justice himself for his actions. Robert commands both of them to be quiet. He orders Ned to settle his differences with Ser Jaime and get his wife to release Tyrion, and that would be an end to it. </p> <p>This is not enough for Cersei. She wants Eddard punished. She accuses Eddard and his men, who were returning from a brothel, of assaulting <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>, and he admits that he ordered his wife Catelyn to imprison Tyrion, both grave insults to her noble <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" title="House Lannister">House Lannister</a>. Robert, who as her husband should be on her side, will not condemn him without hearing his side and just tells her to be silent. As Robert is listening to Eddard's request to bring Jaime back to <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a> to face charges for killing Eddard's men, an angry Cersei questions Robert's kingship and manhood, saying that she should wear the armor and he the gown. Fed up, Robert strikes her across the face, shocking his friend Ned. Smiling, Cersei says that she will wear the bruise on her face as a badge of honor. Robert tells her to wear it in silence, or he will honor her again. With one more scathing look at Eddard, Cersei leaves the room, slamming the door. </p> <p>Robert blames Cersei for provoking him, but admits that he shouldn't have hit her. He pours himself a drink and sits at the end of the bed. Lord Eddard warns him that they must act, for events are drawing them to what could be open warfare. King Robert tells Eddard that he must order his wife to return Tyrion. As for Jaime, he cannot be put on trial for killing the Stark men, because the kingdom is too deeply in debt to his father <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>. Robert tells Eddard that he neither knows nor cares what the argument between the Starks and the Lannisters entails, he just wants Eddard to make peace, because their conflict is damaging the equilibrium of the kingdom, and he cannot rule if these two important Houses are engaged in conflict. This is not precisely true. When things go smoothly, Robert doesn't have to deal with them, he doesn't have to rule, he just delegates authority. And this time is no different. </p> <p>When Eddard asks leave to return to <a href="/wiki/Winterfell" title="Winterfell">Winterfell</a>, now that he is no longer <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand</a>, Robert refuses to accept Eddard's resignation (nothing has changed since he named Eddard as Hand, the king is still surrounded by enemies and needs one person near him that he can trust). Robert admits to Eddard that he never loved either <a href="/wiki/Renly" title="Renly" class="mw-redirect">Renly</a> or <a href="/wiki/Stannis" title="Stannis" class="mw-redirect">Stannis</a> and that Eddard was the man he chose to think of as brother. He tosses the badge of the Hand onto the bed next to Ned and announces his intention to go hunting; Robert says that killing things clears his head. He says that Eddard will have to rule in his stead, and that he will hate sitting on the throne even more than Robert. </p> <p>As the king is leaving, Eddard brings up <a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> (the ordering of her assassination was the reason Eddard had resigned). Robert refuses to reconsider. He orders Ned to put on the badge of office and swears to the Mother that, if he ever resigns again, Robert will appoint Jaime Lannister to the post. Eddard is left staring with trepidation at the symbol of the Hand. </p> <h2 id="Scene_2" section="2">Scene 2</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":1}' data-ref="1"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ad/Dany_and_the_egg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160803011500"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201200%20642'%2F%3E" alt="Dany and the egg.jpg" width="1200" height="642"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ad/Dany_and_the_egg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160803011500" alt="Dany and the egg.jpg" width="1200" height="642"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Daenerys wonders if the heat of a brazier will hatch a dragon egg.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Daenerys" title="Daenerys" class="mw-redirect">Daenerys</a> is in her tent in <a href="/wiki/Vaes_Dothrak" title="Vaes Dothrak">Vaes Dothrak</a>, holding one of her dragon eggs.

A concerned Irri rushes over and takes the egg from Daenerys, dropping it almost immediately. She turns Daenerys' hands over and is amazed to see they are white and unharmed. While Irri's own hands, which held the smoldering egg for just a second, are both scalded. Daenerys shows concern that Irri is hurt, Irri herself looks dumbfounded. </p> <h2 id="Scene_3" section="3">Scene 3</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":2}' data-ref="2"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/Three-eyed_raven.png/revision/latest?cb=20110622101243"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20465%20340'%2F%3E" alt="Three-eyed raven.png" width="465" height="340"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/Three-eyed_raven.png/revision/latest?cb=20110622101243" alt="Three-eyed raven.png" width="465" height="340"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Bran dreams of the three-eyed Raven.</figcaption></figure><p>A three-eyed raven stands and caws on a hay wagon, in front of archery targets. <a href="/wiki/Brandon_Stark" title="Brandon Stark" class="mw-redirect">Bran</a>, about to shoot an arrow stares at it and slowly lowers the bow.

Bran is on horseback riding in circles around a clearing. <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a> and Theon sit in the center of the clearing, on a large log. They are smiling, while watching Bran happily riding. They have received news of the grave events that have occurred in King's Landing, and <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Theon</a> asks Robb when he plans to tell Bran about them, but Robb says that the time isn't right. Theon advises Robb to seek retribution on the Lannisters for their crimes against <a href="/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a>. Lord Eddard has been injured, and <a href="/wiki/Jory_Cassel" title="Jory Cassel">Jory</a> and the other Stark men have been killed. For Theon, the justice of the matter is simple, blood has been spilled and only blood can pay for it. He tells Robb that it is his duty, and Theon warns Robb that, as he has been left as acting lord, it may be necessary for him to call up the bannermen of the North. War may be coming. Robb thinks that marching on <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a> is not what he should do now, and these decisions are too important to be made hastily. Regardless, they are his to make not Theon. He insults Theon by reminding him that it is not his house. </p> <p>They come to realize that it is quiet; Bran is gone. Robb asks Theon where Bran is, but a still insulted Theon replies that he doesn't know, as it's not his house. He then stalks off into the woods. </p> <h2 id="Scene_6" section="6">Scene 6</h2> <p>Bran is riding <a href="/wiki/Dancer" title="Dancer">his horse</a> over a small stream and through the forest. Ragged unkept people start creeping after him, trying to stay hidden in the forrest shrubbery. There are four of them, two Night's Watch deserters, and two wildlings, of which one is a woman named <a href="/wiki/Osha" title="Osha">Osha</a>. They sneak up as Bran is trying to control his suddenly skittish horse.

Bran says that he cannot. When they pull back his cloak and see the straps holding him in the saddle, they realize that he is telling the truth. Stiv angers Bran by asking if he is a cripple.

Robb checks the cut on Bran's leg, which Bran assures him doesn't hurt, and then picks him up. </p> <p>Theon praises Robb for his actions in the fight, calling them well done. On the Iron Islands, one is not considered a man until his first kill, but Robb looking at the dead men littering the forest floor, doesn't look happy at all. Theon is expecting to be praised in return for saving Bran's life, but instead Robb is furious at him for firing that arrow as Bran could have been hurt. When Theon wants to know if Robb expected him to just stand there and let him and Bran be killed, Robb has no answer. Osha puts her hands together and begs for her life. All the others are dead, but if Robb will spare her, she promises to serve him.

Syrio at first is concerned, but, when he gets close enough, he hits her with the wooden sword. He explains that when your thoughts are troubled that is the perfect time to practice. In a real fight, she can not expect to be calm. Arya takes offense when he says her fights will not occur when she is in a meadow playing with her dolls. She must learn to control her thoughts and emotions. He hits her with the sword until she angrily strikes back, but he then easily knocks her over. If she cannot concentrate when in a fight, she will lose. </p> <p>Syrio knows that she is worried about her father and asks her if she prays to the Gods.

It is Ser Jorah who reminds him that to draw a sword in the sacred city is a crime, and he could face punishment, if a Dothraki sees him; Viserys just sneers that those are Dothraki laws, not his. Viserys turns back and takes the other eggs, but, as he tries to leave with the eggs, Jorah won't let him. Viserys plans to sell the eggs and buy himself an army, as he is tired of waiting on Drogo. He says to be a king one must be feared or loved. He is jealous of Daenerys, for living in exile, he has never had any of the adoration that Dany has from the Dothraki. Viserys says that he knows Jorah has physical desires for Daenerys, but he simply doesn't care. Viserys just wants to be allowed to leave with the eggs, but Jorah won't let him. Viserys reminds Jorah that he took an oath of loyalty to Viserys, but Jorah won't back down. Viserys must drop the bag with the eggs and stalk out of the tent in frustration, as Jorah watches him walk away. </p> <h2 id="Scene_11" section="11">Scene 11</h2> <p>Tyrion is once again at the door of the sky cell in the Eyrie, calling for Mord.

Catelyn stands beside the throne watching as her nephew repeatedly taps a knife against its arm. Tyrion acknowledges that he wishes to confess his crimes, and Lysa is pleased, commenting to Catelyn that he has been broken by the sky cell. She instructs the "Imp" to speak. As the whole court stands watching, Tyrion appears to struggle with the relating of his crimes. However, when he begins, the crimes he confesses to are merely those of lying, gambling, cheating, encouraging violent behavior, whore-mongering, and playing nasty practical jokes. He took the robe of a servant girl bathing in a river, and she had to return to the castle naked. He masturbated into a bowl of turtle stew that he believes Cersei may have eaten (at least he hopes she did). He filled his uncle's boots with goat excrement and blamed a squire for it. He brought a donkey and a honeycomb into a brothel. From the court, there are mixed reactions ranging from chuckles to groans. Bronn, in the back of the room, is laughing, and <a href="/wiki/Robin_Arryn" title="Robin Arryn">Robin Arryn</a> wants to know what happened next. Finally, Lysa loses patience with this, and Lady Catelyn asks him to speak directly on the charges of which he has been accused, conspiring in the murder of <a href="/wiki/Jon_Arryn" title="Jon Arryn">Jon Arryn</a> and the attempted murder of <a href="/wiki/Brandon_Stark" title="Brandon Stark" class="mw-redirect">Brandon Stark</a>. </p> <p>However, Tyrion says he has nothing to confess about these crimes, as he is innocent of these charges. Lysa instructs Mord to return Tyrion to a smaller, less comfortable cell than the one that he previously occupied. Tyrion reacts with anger at the lack of justice in the <a href="/wiki/Vale" title="Vale" class="mw-redirect">Vale</a>. He has been accused of a crime and punished (imprisoned, beaten, and left to starve in a freezing cell) without benefit of a trial. Catelyn gives one of many looks toward her sister, Lysa Arryn, as she realizes that things are beginning to progress out of her control. Lysa explains that in the Eyrie there is no need of an executioner and calls for the moon door to be opened. It is a round metal door set in the center of the floor of the High Hall (its two metal sides pulled apart by two men turning a large wheel on the wall). Robin claps his hands in anticipation of seeing Tyrion flung to his death. Lysa agrees that there will be a trial and, if found guilty, Tyrion will die. Tyrion may present evidence, and, afterward (Lysa says with a smile), Robin will act as judge and give the verdict. </p> <p>But Tyrion announces he wants his innocence proved in a trial by combat. There is scattered laughter from the court. Lysa realizes that this is Tyrion's right, and, because the entire court is there as witness, she is trapped and must agree to it. Many nobles step forward and ask to be named Lysa's champion to fight Tyrion, but Lysa calls on Ser <a href="/wiki/Vardis_Egen" title="Vardis Egen">Vardis Egen</a>, as he is her best fighter. Ser Egen kneels and assures Lady Arryn that he would gladly fight for her, but he believes the contest to be an unfair one. When Tyrion wishes to name a champion, Vardis agrees to meet Tyrion's champion in battle. Tyrion wants them to send a raven to <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>, but Lysa says that the trial will be held today. Hearing that he will not be facing Ser Jaime, Ser Vardis lets out a sigh of relief. Tyrion asks for a volunteer, and there are only chuckles from the court. After several appeals by an increasingly nervous Tyrion and just when it seems that no-one will fight for him, <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> volunteers with a shrug (on the trip to the Eyrie, Tyrion had made efforts to get close to Bronn and to tell him of the financial rewards for anyone doing favors for the Lannisters). </p> <h2 id="Scene_13" section="13">Scene 13</h2> <p>Robert, Renly, Ser <a href="/wiki/Barristan_Selmy" title="Barristan Selmy">Barristan Selmy</a>, and Robert's squire <a href="/wiki/Lancel_Lannister" title="Lancel Lannister">Lancel Lannister</a> are seen walking through the forest on their hunt.

When the enemies were obvious, vicious warriors in the open, not hidden schemers. Renly tries to take part in the conversation, sarcastically saying it sounded exciting, but Robert responds by insulting Renly's life, and the balls and masquerades he likes to throw.

Homes, fields, and granaries were burned. Women were raped and murdered. Children were butchered. Pycelle is of the opinion that these were probably brigands, and he corrects the man who has referred to Lord Eddard by the title "your grace". He introduces Eddard as the King's Hand, who is presiding as the king is hunting. Brigands, the refugee says, would have taken things. These men took nothing; on the contrary, they left something behind. A cloth sack of rotting fish is emptied out onto the floor. </p> <p>When asked, the survivor replies that the attackers carried no banners, but that their leader was a foot taller than any man he had ever seen and was capable of cutting the head of a horse with a single blow of a sword. Petyr Baelish whispers to Eddard that they have seen this feat themselves (the Mountain-Ser Gregor did this at the Hand's Tournament).

Ser Gregor Clegane is widely known as <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>'s Mad Dog. The attack on the Riverlands could be revenge on Catelyn Stark (née <a href="/wiki/Tully" title="Tully" class="mw-redirect">Tully</a>, whose sigil is a fish), as she had been responsible for the imprisonment of Tyrion Lannister. And as for overt acts of violence, could this be any more overt than attacking the King's Hand on the streets of King's Landing.

He says it will be someone brave, gentle, and strong, but Sansa says that she doesn't want someone like that, she wants Joffrey.

Drogo laughs, attracting the attention of Viserys, who comes toward him intending to join the feast. Drogo waves toward the back of the room, and Jorah points out to Viserys that there is a place for him (and tries to lead him to the area set aside for youths unproven in battle). </p> <p>Viserys does not consider this the place for a king, but Khal Drogo, who has by now learned a little of the <a href="/wiki/Common_Tongue" title="Common Tongue">common tongue</a>, points out, accurately, that Viserys is no king. That enrages Viserys, who draws his sword and threatens those around him. To draw a sword in the sacred city could be punishable by death, and Ser Jorah warns Viserys that the Dothraki could kill them all for this. Daenerys calls out for him to listen, and Viserys comes toward her. Viserys tells Jorah that he is mistaken, for the Dothraki cannot kill him as it is against their laws to shed blood in <a href="/wiki/Vaes_Dothrak" title="Vaes Dothrak">Vaes Dothrak</a>; he however is not bound by the same laws.

Then he demands the crown that Drogo promised him. Viserys is tired of waiting for Drogo to fulfill his promises. As Viserys sees it, he sold Daenerys to Drogo, but the Khal has not paid him for her. Therefore, he will take her back. Irri translates for Drogo, including Viserys' final threat that he will cut the baby out of Dany and leave it with the Khal. When Drogo answers, it is Daenerys who translates for Viserys. Drogo will give him "a golden crown that men shall tremble to behold". </p> <p>Smiling and nervously laughing, Viserys backs away as this was simply all he wanted. Drogo comes up to Daenerys and puts his hand on her stomach; she steadily holds his gaze as Drogo calls to his men. Drogo's bloodriders come up behind Viserys and grab him, breaking his arm to make him drop his sword in agony. He screams, still protesting that he is the dragon and cannot be treated in this way, as they force him to his knees. Drogo goes to the firepit, unbuckling the belt of gold medallions he wears about his waist. A servant pours the soup out of the pot over the fire, and Drogo drops the belt into it. </p> <p>As the danger he has put himself in finally dawns on Viserys, fear appears in his eyes. Daenerys watches without emotion. Not only does she realize that Viserys would make a bad king, unable to lead an army nor take her home. Also, he will always be a threat to her, her child, and even her marriage. Defending him will only damage her standing with the Dothraki, so she will not continue to do so. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she will not.
