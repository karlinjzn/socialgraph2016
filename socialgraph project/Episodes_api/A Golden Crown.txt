She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Hand" title="King's Hand" class="mw-redirect">King's Hand</a>, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister. He tells Lord Eddard to end the animosity between <a href="/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a> and <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" title="House Lannister">House Lannister</a>, as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns. </p> <p><a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a> has another <a href="/wiki/Water_Dance" title="Water Dance">"dancing"</a> lesson with <a href="/wiki/Syrio_Forel" title="Syrio Forel">Syrio Forel</a>, but isn't in the mood due to <a href="/wiki/Jory" title="Jory" class="mw-redirect">Jory</a>'s death. Syrio tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness. </p> <p>King Robert is out hunting, accompanied by his brother <a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly</a>, Ser <a href="/wiki/Barristan_Selmy" title="Barristan Selmy">Barristan Selmy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lancel_Lannister" title="Lancel Lannister">Lancel Lannister</a>. Robert, being supplied with wine by Lancel, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. Renly storms off, leaving Ser Barristan to look on concerned, as Lancel keeps up King Robert's wine supply. </p> <p>In King's Landing, at a meeting of the <a href="/wiki/Small_council" title="Small council" class="mw-redirect">small council</a>, a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. Eddard hears tales of a huge knight ravaging <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">the Riverlands</a>. He realizes that it's Ser <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a>, "The Mountain", who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the Riverlands - which are held by <a href="/wiki/House_Tully" title="House Tully">House Tully</a>, the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds Tyrion captive. Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the Lannisters, Lord Eddard could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. Eddard strips Gregor Clegane of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord <a href="/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion" title="Beric Dondarrion">Beric Dondarrion</a> with a retinue of one hundred <a href="/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knights</a> to arrest and execute him in the king's name.  </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":3}' data-ref="3"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/49/Eddard_and_the_book.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160802225117"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201200%20643'%2F%3E" alt="Eddard and the book.jpg" width="1200" height="643"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/49/Eddard_and_the_book.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160802225117" alt="Eddard and the book.jpg" width="1200" height="643"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Eddard discovers the secret <a href="/wiki/Jon_Arryn" title="Jon Arryn">Jon Arryn</a> died for.</figcaption></figure><p>He also orders Grand Maester <a href="/wiki/Pycelle" title="Pycelle">Pycelle</a> to send word to <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a>, demanding Lord <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.

Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Lord Eddard says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses—she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies.

Given that Lysa's <a href="/wiki/Robin_Arryn" title="Robin Arryn">son</a> is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, Tyrion instead demands a <a href="/wiki/Trial_by_combat" title="Trial by combat">trial by combat</a>, which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and Ser <a href="/wiki/Vardis_Egen" title="Vardis Egen">Vardis Egen</a> agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. Tyrion names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present.

She eats a stallion's heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems Dany won't keep the raw meat down, but, to both her and Drogo's relief, she is able to compose herself.

title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a> was skeptical when seeing her casting tape, but was impressed and convinced by her performance, saying it may affect how he writes Osha in future novels. </li> <li> This episode is the final appearance of starring cast member <a href="/wiki/Harry_Lloyd" title="Harry Lloyd">Harry Lloyd</a> (<a href="/wiki/Viserys_Targaryen" title="Viserys Targaryen">Viserys Targaryen</a>) due to the death of his character. </li> <li> Although credited <a href="/wiki/Finn_Jones" title="Finn Jones">Finn Jones</a> does not appear in this episode. </li> <li> Patrick Rocks is credited as a guest star, but no name is given for his character. His book counterpart, the first one to offer himself as a champion to Lady Lysa, is identified as a member of House Lynderly, but his name is not revealed. </li> <li> Barrington Cullen is credited as a guest star, but no name is given for his character. His book counterpart is Lord Eon Hunter, who speaks exactly the same lines, but is described as being older than Jon Arryn and half-crippled by gout. He's also one of the many suitors that seek Lady Lysa's hand. </li> </ul> <h2 id="Notes" section="14">Notes</h2> <ul> <li> The episode takes its name from the "golden crown" <a href="/wiki/Drogo" title="Drogo">Drogo</a> gives <a href="/wiki/Viserys" title="Viserys" class="mw-redirect">Viserys</a>. <ul><li> It may also have a metaphorical meaning in that the word "crown" can also refer to the top of one's head or the entire head.  So, a "golden crown" when "crown" is used this way, could mean blond-headed or, to use the terminology from this episode, "golden haired."  </li></ul> </li> <li>Actor Sean Bean had the flu while filming this episode, so the fevered appearance that Ned Stark has after being stabbed in the leg (particularly when he first wakes up in bed and speaks with Robert and Cersei) is actually a genuine physical reaction by the actor.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> </li> <li> According to Emilia Clarke, for the scene where Daenerys eats a horse's heart, the prop she used was made of gummi bear-like material; it tasted awful even though she likes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummi_bear" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Gummi bear">Gummi bears</a>. Her difficulty choking it down is her actual physical reaction. The gummi-heart was injected with fake-blood which was basically a sugary syrup, so that it could burst out as she bit into the heart. The crew kept injecting it to maintain moisture. By the end the actress was covered in the stuff which was like glue and everything stuck to her. When she used the bathroom she stuck to the toilet seat.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> </li> <li>Viserys notes that Jorah Mormont is blocking him from leaving with the dragon eggs by saying "Here you stand", and Jorah stares him down by replying and emphasizing "Yet here I stand". In the books, the motto of House Mormont is actually stated to be "Here We Stand". Its not clear if this was an intentional reference. </li> <li> Originally the meaning of the phrase "make the eight" was unclear. However, it appears to be a reference to the fact that the Riverlands, having been under the occupation of the King of the Iron Islands at the time of Aegon's conquest, is not counted as one of the Seven Kingdoms in the TV series. In the novels, the term is considerably looser and more open to interpretation. </li> <li>Set designer and art director, <a href="/wiki/Gemma_Jackson" title="Gemma Jackson">Gemma Jackson</a> credits the inspiration for the Eyrie as being the Basilica Di San Clemente in Rome. The Weirwood Throne was actually three pieces of wood and was unpainted. And the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall_(Red_Keep)" title="Great Hall (Red Keep)" class="mw-redirect">Great Hall of the Red Keep</a> was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> </li> <li>The trial by combat scene had to be filmed across multiple takes, and during one actor <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Flynn" title="Jerome Flynn">Jerome Flynn</a> (Bronn) accidentally slipped and fell on melted wax, which was left there from a previous take when he knocked over the candelabra. Once, he even fell into the prop opening for the Moon Door.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> </li> <li> Joffrey mentions the northern and southern-most castles of Westeros as being the Last Hearth in the north (the seat of <a href="/wiki/House_Umber" title="House Umber">House Umber</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Saltshore" title="Saltshore">Saltshore</a> (in <a href="/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a>) in the south. This is not strictly accurate: the northern-most castles in the realm are the castles at <a href="/wiki/The_Wall" title="The Wall">the Wall</a>, most notably <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a>. It is arguable that the southern-most castles are actually on the island known as <a href="/wiki/The_Arbor" title="The Arbor">the Arbor</a>, but the maps do not reveal at what end of the island the castles lie. It is possible that Joffrey omitted the castles of the Night's Watch on the Wall due to their extra-legal status, and also he was speaking of the "lords and ladies" who would come to a royal wedding, which the Night's Watch doesn't have. </li> <li> There was a discussion of how Jack Gleason should play this scene. At first he was going to be disingenuous, but then it was decided that he was more weak than evil, as he is not utterly corrupted until he inherits the throne. He is sincerely apologizing as he did really want a girlfriend. The scene was filmed in an overly romantic way to make it seem melodramatic.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup> </li> <li> Eddard mentions several members of <a href="/wiki/House_Baratheon" title="House Baratheon">House Baratheon</a> detailed in the novels while reading the house's entry in Pycelle's book: <a href="/wiki/Orys_Baratheon" title="Orys Baratheon">Orys Baratheon</a>, the founder of the house; <a href="/wiki/Lyonel_Baratheon" title="Lyonel Baratheon">Lyonel Baratheon</a>, the Laughing Storm, a great knight featured in <a href="/wiki/George_R.R._Martin" title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a>'s "Dunk and Egg" stories; and <a href="/wiki/Steffon_Baratheon" title="Steffon Baratheon">Steffon Baratheon</a>, the father of Robert, Renly and Stannis. </li> <li>Viserys' death scene had to be performed in only one take, because it would ruin his costume after the first and only attempt. Smoke machines were strapped to his back and chest, a bald cap was made to resemble molten gold across his face, and the props department forged a gold-like substance that was poured over his head.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[7]</a></sup> </li> </ul> <h2 id="Commentary" section="15">Commentary</h2> <p>The Blu-ray and DVD releases of this episode feature a commentary by director Daniel Minahan and actor Peter Dinklage in New York City, and Harry Lloyd and Emilia Clarke in London. </p> <ul> <li> The scene where Robert forces Eddard to become the Hand again was Mark Addy's last scene shot for the series. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage points out that Mark Addy is not as big as Robert in the books, but Mark's larger-than-life performance sells the role. </li> <li> The costume and make-up designers worked hard not to make Harry Lloyd look like Legolas from the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_(movie_trilogy)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Lord of the Rings (movie trilogy)">Lord of the Rings</a></i> movies. </li> <li> Emilia Clarke was charmed when Isaac Hempstead-Wright gave her half his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_(chocolate_bar)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Fudge (chocolate bar)">Fudge</a> bar. </li> <li> Harry Lloyd is a fan of Natalia Tena's band. </li> <li> There was some debate about using CGI breath for the really cold scenes filmed in warmer weather, but it was decided it looked too fake. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage was unaware that Maisie Williams used her off-hand for the sword-fighting scenes to match Arya in the books, and was impressed. Maisie cried on cue during the read-through of the scene where she has to drive Nymeria away, impressing Harry Lloyd. </li> <li>Peter Dinklage said that the scene where Daenerys eats the horse's heart is his wife's favorite scene of the entire series. </li> <li> The scene between Viserys and Jorah was discussed between the two actors and David Benioff to get the right tone to the scene. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage had no padding for the scenes where Mord beats him in the sky cell, so ended up with some bruises at the end of the day. </li> <li> Some actors were given prosthetic scars while others had real scars that were highlighted with make-up. </li> <li> The throne dais in the Eyrie had no safety rail, so actress Kate Dickie was directed to keep hold of Lino Facioli when he stood up as a safety precaution. </li> <li> The Moon Door actually led to a pit filled with cardboard boxes. </li> <li> Harry Lloyd likens the Vale to Wales, so finds the fact that Ser Vardis Egen has a Welsh accent very appropriate. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage was a fan of Kate Dickie from some of her British film work and was looking forward to meeting her. </li> <li> Originally the episode opened with Ser Gregor Clegane sacking a village in the Riverlands, but this was cut for time and budget reasons. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke only read the books once they have finished filming, so as to be surprised by the process as it goes along. Bryan Cogman also tracked down scenes from later books that gave more info about the characters and their motivations and recommended them to the actors. </li> <li> Harry Lloyd looks at fan art online, and particularly enjoyed a fan map of <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a> that he found on the Internet. </li> <li> Emilia Clarke was disappointed that the elaborate and lengthy climb to the Eyrie was not in the TV series. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage noted the name similarity between Jack Gleeson and comedian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> and found it amusing. </li> <li> Peter Dinklage debated with his wife whether it was realistic for there to be only one prostitute in Winterfell. However, she pointed out in a small community there was only likely to be one, or at least one popular one. </li> <li> The coin Ros catches from the back of the cart was CGI. (Harry Lloyd mishears the comment, however, and momentarily thinks they said Ros's "flash" was CGI). </li> <li> According to Peter Dinklage, the CGI budget for Season 2 will be 'huge'. </li> <li> Harry Lloyd studied a lot of 'drunk walking' videos on YouTube for his final scene. </li> <li> The sword Harry Lloyd used in the final scene was very sharp and had to be handled carefully. </li> <li> Drogo's gold belt melted far too quickly. Lloyd deadpans this is because it is 'Dothraki hybrid gold' that melts much more quickly than normal and then solidifies again. </li> <li> The final shot of Daenerys required multiple takes as it was tricky to keep the camera in focus as it zoomed in close on her face. </li> <li> For the scene where Viserys is 'crowned', the prop department attached smoke machines to Harry Lloyd's back and front and placed a bald cap over his head to make it look like his hair and skin was being burned. They also created a gold-looking (but cold) liquid to pour over his head. Due to the complexity of the scene, the scene had to be nailed in one take, which was successfully achieved. </li> </ul> <h2 id="In_the_books" section="16">In the books</h2> <dl><dd> <i>See: <a href="/wiki/Differences_between_books_and_TV_series_-_Season_1#A_Golden_Crown" title="Differences between books and TV series - Season 1">Differences between books and TV series - Season 1#A Golden Crown</a> </i> </dd></dl> <ul><li> The episode is adapted from the following chapters of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>: <ul> <li> Chapter 37, Bran V. </li> <li> Chapter 38, Tyrion V. </li> <li> Chapter 39, Eddard X. </li> <li> Chapter 40, Catelyn VII. </li> <li> Chapter 43, Eddard XI. </li> <li> Chapter 44, Sansa III. </li> <li> Chapter 46, Daenerys V. </li> </ul> </li></ul> <h2 id="Memorable_quotes" section="17">Memorable quotes</h2> <p><b><a href="/wiki/Syrio_Forel" title="Syrio Forel">Syrio Forel</a></b>: "There is only one god.
