Also to Ethan and Gregor, two lords of the house who have been "lost". </li> <li> Beshka tells Asher that the Yunkai freedmen offered a reward of 800 Gold Dragons for the capture of a Wise Master. The Lost Legion then say they're only going to pay them 400 Gold Dragons. Gold Dragons are actually the <a href="/wiki/Currency" title="Currency">Currency</a> used in the Seven Kingdoms, not Yunkai: Slaver's Bay uses gold coins known as "honors". That being said it is easy to explain that other characters, knowing Asher is from Westeros, simply calculated the conversion from Yunkai'i honors to Westerosi Gold Dragons so that Asher would understand how much they were offering. The Seven Kingdoms are a major part of international trade so people in most port cities probably know the going exchange rate. As was last seen in Season 3's "<a href="/wiki/Second_Sons_(episode)" title="Second Sons (episode)">Second Sons</a>", <a href="/wiki/Mero" title="Mero">Mero</a> had coins from cities as distant as <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Meereen" title="Meereen">Meereen</a>: sellswords move around a lot, so they are familiar with accepting payment in diverse coinages. That is, it is possible that sellsword companies would be familiar with working in a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Reserve currency">reserve currencies</a> popular across wide areas, such as the Westerosi Gold Dragon or Braavosi coins, etc. <ul><li>As for the size of the reward, to put it in perspective, a knight's horse is worth about one Gold Dragon, and a full suit of steel armor (considered to be very expensive) costs around two Gold Dragons (depending on the quality). </li></ul> </li> <li>The <a href="/wiki/Lost_Legion" title="Lost Legion">Lost Legion</a> at Yunkai speak in <a href="/wiki/Low_Valyrian" title="Low Valyrian">Low Valyrian</a>. Linguist <a href="/wiki/David_J._Peterson" title="David J. Peterson">David J. Peterson</a> from the main TV series provided the translations.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> </li> <li>The Lost Legion was invented by Telltale Games and have no direct counterpart in the novels. However, there are numerous sellsword companies operating across the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay, many more than have been described or mentioned by name, so a group like the Lost Legion could quite plausibly exist in the background. <ul><li>People of Valyrian descent, such as the Targaryens, have purple-colored irises in the novels. The TV series was going to do this using colored eye contact lenses but quickly abandoned it: noting that "actors act with their eyes" it was felt that the contact lenses were too distracting, and affecting actors' performances. The video game developers felt no such restrictions, given that the physical appearance of characters is separated from their voice actors, so they did give many of the Lost Legion members purple irises. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Cotter" title="Cotter">Cotter</a> is said to have been sent to the Wall for stealing potatoes. In the novels, <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drink#New_World_crops" title="Food and Drink">New World crops apparently don't exist in Westeros</a> - or at least, crops such as tobacco or potatoes have never been mentioned. The TV series, however, has already made multiple references to "potatoes", and the Telltale video game is set in the TV continuity, so it is simply going along with a change the TV writers already made. </li> </ul> <h2 id="Memorable_Quotes" section="18">Memorable Quotes</h2> <p></p> <blockquote>I still don't understand.
