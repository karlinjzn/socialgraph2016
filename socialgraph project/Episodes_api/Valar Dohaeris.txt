He sees another man of the Night's Watch up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands. Just then, a wight approaches Sam and is about to attack him with an axe when the <a href="/wiki/Direwolves" title="Direwolves">direwolf</a> <a href="/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">Ghost</a> knocks it down. Ghost continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards Sam. The wight suddenly burst into flame, destroyed by a torch wielded by Lord Commander <a href="/wiki/Jeor_Mormont" title="Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</a>, killing it. Mormont has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the <a href="/wiki/Fist_of_the_First_Men" title="Fist of the First Men">Fist of the First Men</a>. Mormont is angry that Sam wasn't able to send off any messenger-<a href="/wiki/Ravens" title="Ravens">ravens</a> in the confusion of the attack. Mormont announces that they must retreat back to <a href="/wiki/The_Wall" title="The Wall">the Wall</a>, not simply to save their own lives but because <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a> and the rest of Westeros must be warned of the coming threat―otherwise everyone they've ever known will die. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> is led by <a href="/wiki/Ygritte" title="Ygritte">Ygritte</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Bones" title="Lord of Bones">Lord of Bones</a> into the main <a href="/wiki/Free_Folk" title="Free Folk">wildling</a> camp in the <a href="/wiki/Frostfangs" title="Frostfangs">Frostfangs</a> mountains. It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the White Walkers, including women and children. As they enter the camp, Jon is shocked to see a real-life <a href="/wiki/Giants" title="Giants">giant</a> walk past. Many of the wildlings are surprised to see Jon in his all-black Night's Watch clothing and shout "Crow!" at his approach. Several young boys pelt Jon with ice and small stones, but Ygritte shoos them away. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":3}' data-ref="3"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bf/Giant_working_S3_Ep1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130402143557"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201362%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Giant working S3 Ep1.jpg" width="1362" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/b/bf/Giant_working_S3_Ep1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130402143557" alt="Giant working S3 Ep1.jpg" width="1362" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Giant carrying mammoth bones</figcaption></figure><p>Jon is led into the tent of <a href="/wiki/King-Beyond-the-Wall" title="King-Beyond-the-Wall">King-Beyond-the-Wall</a> <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a>, where the Lord of Bones explains that he is <a href="/wiki/Ned_Stark" title="Ned Stark" class="mw-redirect">Ned Stark</a>'s bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire. He says that he doesn't care, but his interest is piqued on hearing that Jon killed <a href="/wiki/Qhorin_Halfhand" title="Qhorin Halfhand" class="mw-redirect">Qhorin Halfhand</a>. As they talk, Jon kneels before the man, whom he assumes to be Mance Rayder, and calls him "Your Grace" as he would a king south of the Wall. All the wildlings to burst into laughter; their society does not bother with such ceremony–and because the man actually isn't Mance, but his lieutenant <a href="/wiki/Tormund_Giantsbane" title="Tormund Giantsbane" class="mw-redirect">Tormund Giantsbane</a>. Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner, who then introduces himself and tells Jon to stand, as no man kneels before another among the Free Folk, as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture. </p> <p>Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin, as he had killed many of Mance's wildlings, though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once, back when he was a member of the Night's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand. Mance asks Jon why he wants to join them. He replies that he wants to be free, but Mance thinks he just wants to be a hero. Jon then explains that when the Night's Watch camped at <a href="/wiki/Craster%27s_Keep" title="Craster's Keep">Craster's Keep</a>, he saw <a href="/wiki/Craster" title="Craster">Craster</a> <a href="/wiki/The_Night_Lands" title="The Night Lands">leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering</a>, and the inhuman creature that took it. Jon says that he wants to leave the Night's Watch because he is disgusted that Mormont already knew what Craster was doing but did nothing to stop it. Jon states that the <a href="/wiki/First_Men" title="First Men">First Men</a> he is descended from defeated the White Walkers once during <a href="/wiki/The_Long_Night" title="The Long Night">The Long Night</a>, and that now he wants "to fight for the side who fights for the living."

This comes as a shock, because his older brother <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime</a> gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the <a href="/wiki/Kingsguard" title="Kingsguard">Kingsguard</a>, and Tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession. For that matter, despite all evidence to the contrary, Tywin refuses to believe that Tyrion was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand of the King</a>. Instead, Tywin obstinately maintains his belief that Tyrion is a whore-mongering, drunken, "ill-made, spiteful little creature," and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy. Tywin is particularly insulted that Tyrion brought his mistress, <a href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a>, to the capital when Tywin explicitly told him not to, which makes Tywin convince himself that Tyrion was in bed with Shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control. When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this, Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted <i>him</i>, and says it should be obvious as Tyrion "killed" his mother <a href="/wiki/Joanna_Lannister" title="Joanna Lannister">Joanna</a> in childbirth so that he might enter the world. Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name, but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion wasn't his son, so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name "Lannister" which he stole from Tywin. Tyrion fumes at the situation to his <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" title="Mercenary">sellsword</a> <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a>, who has recently been <a href="/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knighted</a> as a reward for his service in the Battle of the Blackwater. He now styles himself as "Ser Bronn of the Blackwater," and while possessing no lands, wealth, or title, this drastically elevates his social standing–and in his mind, his pay. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Joffrey's ride back from the <a href="/wiki/Great_Sept_of_Baelor" title="Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</a> in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed, Lady <a href="/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell" title="Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a>, stops the procession in <a href="/wiki/Flea_Bottom" title="Flea Bottom">Flea Bottom</a> unexpectedly. Margaery shocks the guards and bewilders Joffrey by getting out and exploring, eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children. Meanwhile, her servants pass out bread and toys, earning her the love of Flea Bottom's <a href="/wiki/Smallfolk" title="Smallfolk">smallfolk</a>. That evening, Joffrey and Cersei visit Margaery and her brother <a href="/wiki/Loras_Tyrell" title="Loras Tyrell">Loras Tyrell</a> for a small dinner party. Cersei admonishes Margaery's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the <a href="/wiki/Riot_of_King%27s_Landing" title="Riot of King's Landing">royal party was assaulted</a> weeks earlier. </p> <p>When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother, Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered. Cersei only knows how to rule through fear, but Margaery knows how to win the love of the people she rules over, a skill Cersei lacks. <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart. Sansa wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed, but Shae, in typical fashion, is uninterested. <a href="/wiki/Petyr_Baelish" title="Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</a> arrives to speak with Sansa. </p> <p>She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible. He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea, she might be able to stow away. Sansa advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Ros" title="Ros">Ros</a>, who seems to be acting as Littlefinger's aide, reminisces about the day Sansa was born, when all the bells in <a href="/wiki/Winterfell" title="Winterfell">Winterfell</a> were rung in celebration. She asks Shae to look out for Sansa, particularly in regards to Littlefinger. </p> <p>On <a href="/wiki/Dragonstone" title="Dragonstone" class="mw-redirect">Dragonstone</a>, King <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a>'s shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the Battle of the Blackwater. <a href="/wiki/Davos_Seaworth" title="Davos Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a> is rescued from the sea by <a href="/wiki/Salladhor_Saan" title="Salladhor Saan">Salladhor Saan</a> after being thrown overboard by the <a href="/wiki/Wildfire" title="Wildfire">wildfire</a> blast in the battle. Forlorn over the death of his son <a href="/wiki/Matthos_Seaworth" title="Matthos Seaworth">Matthos</a>, Davos feels that <a href="/wiki/Melisandre" title="Melisandre">Melisandre</a> has led Stannis to disaster, and is horrified to hear from Salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices. After the defeated remnant of Stannis' forces returned to the island, Melisandre ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the <a href="/wiki/R%27hllor" title="R'hllor">Lord of Light</a>. Davos convinces Salladhor to bring him to Dragonstone. He finds Stannis despondent, sitting in the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_the_Painted_Table" title="Chamber of the Painted Table">Chamber of the Painted Table</a> alone with Melisandre. Davos openly calls Melisandre his enemy, condemns her for conducting human sacrifices, and says she is leading Stannis astray. She counters that it was Davos who urged Stannis not to bring her to the battle, and implies that it was actually Davos' fault that thousands of their men burned to death, including his own son. At the mention of his son Davos draws a knife on her in a fit of anger, but he is restrained by the guards, and Stannis orders him put in the dungeon. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0f/Davos_Melisandre_assassination_S3_E1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730022303"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201311%20718'%2F%3E" alt="Davos Melisandre assassination S3 E1.jpg" width="1311" height="718"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0f/Davos_Melisandre_assassination_S3_E1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730022303" alt="Davos Melisandre assassination S3 E1.jpg" width="1311" height="718"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Davos tries to kill Melisandre</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">the Riverlands</a>, the morale of King <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a>'s army is starting to wane. They have not had a significant victory since the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Oxcross" title="Battle of Oxcross">Battle of Oxcross</a> months ago, and the news of the Lannisters' victory over Stannis and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news. Robb has won every battle he has ever fought, but the Lannisters finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on, so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb's army. Robb's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories, as the Lannisters are now determined to simply wait Robb out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies. In frustration, Robb launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of <a href="/wiki/Harrenhal" title="Harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>, which Tywin had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the Riverlands during the first year of the war. However, Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for: Tywin withdrew his garrison to King's Landing to counter the attack by Stannis, and didn't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle. Robb and his forces are further demoralized to find that the Lannisters massacred two hundred Northern and Riverlands prisoners of war before they left, and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies. They do find one survivor, a <a href="/wiki/Maesters" title="Maesters">maester</a> named <a href="/wiki/Qyburn" title="Qyburn">Qyburn</a>. </p> <h3 id="Across_the_Narrow_Sea" section="5">Across the Narrow Sea</h3> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":6}' data-ref="6"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/74/Drogo_fire_with_fish_S3_Ep1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130402123049"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Drogo fire with fish S3 Ep1.jpg" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/74/Drogo_fire_with_fish_S3_Ep1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130402123049" alt="Drogo fire with fish S3 Ep1.jpg" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Drogon roasts a fish</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a>'s ship arrives at the city of <a href="/wiki/Astapor" title="Astapor">Astapor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Slaver%27s_Bay" title="Slaver's Bay" class="mw-redirect">Slaver's Bay</a> after leaving <a href="/wiki/Qarth" title="Qarth">Qarth</a>. Daenerys' <a href="/wiki/Dragons" title="Dragons">dragons</a> are continuing to grow, and are now about the size of small dogs. They fly about their ship as it approaches the city, plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade <a href="/wiki/Westeros" title="Westeros">Westeros</a> with, and that she needs an army. Ser <a href="/wiki/Jorah_Mormont" title="Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</a> notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in Astapor, known as the <a href="/wiki/Unsullied" title="Unsullied">Unsullied</a>, are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world. Daenerys stresses that they are <i><a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slave</a></i>-soldiers, a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in Westeros where slavery is illegal, but Jorah says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army. Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny <a href="/wiki/Dothraki" title="Dothraki">Dothraki</a> <a href="/wiki/Khalasar" title="Khalasar">khalasar</a> (most of them are seasick because the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before), but Jorah says that other Dothraki will only join her if they think she is strong, and for that she needs an army. </p> <p>Upon arriving at Astapor, Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied's owner, <a href="/wiki/Kraznys_mo_Nakloz" title="Kraznys mo Nakloz">Kraznys mo Nakloz</a>, with his slave girl <a href="/wiki/Missandei" title="Missandei">Missandei</a> translating his <a href="/wiki/Low_Valyrian" title="Low Valyrian">Low Valyrian</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Common_Tongue" title="Common Tongue">Common Tongue</a> of Westeros for Daenerys. They explain that the Unsullied are trained for battle from the age of five, and that only one in four recruits survives the training. Kraznys also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier (much to Daenerys's disgust), who not only shows no sign of pain, but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him. Kraznys goes on to explain that the Unsullied are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training.

Commonly used in <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a>, "valar morghulis" means "all men must die" (in the sense of "all men must [eventually] die [sooner or later]"), and "valar dohaeris" means "all men must serve." Interestingly, the words are not spoken at any point during the episode, and would not be spoken until "<i><a href="/wiki/The_Climb" title="The Climb">The Climb</a>.</i>" </li> <li>This episode marks the introduction of a <a href="/wiki/Low_Valyrian" title="Low Valyrian">Low Valyrian</a> language, spoken by Missandei and others in Slaver's Bay. Daenerys has in previous episodes demonstrated an understanding of High Valyrian, the language from which Low Valyrian is derived. High Valyrian was designed by linguist <a href="/wiki/David_J._Peterson" title="David J. Peterson">David J. Peterson</a>, who wrote sentences down in the language then applied phonological, semantic and grammatical changes to simulate Ghiscari influence and create the Slaver's Bay Low Valyrian heard in the episode.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> </li> <li>The storylines of <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon Stark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/House_Greyjoy" title="House Greyjoy">House Greyjoy</a> do not appear in this episode. </li> <li>A few scenes with <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a> were filmed for the first episode of Season 3, but it was later decided that the episode was getting over-crowded, so all of Arya's scenes were moved to the next episode. Both episodes have the same director anyway (Daniel Minahan), though the season premiere was written by Benioff and Weiss, while the second episode is written by Vanessa Taylor.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> </li> <li>This episode marks the introduction of the non-human race of <a href="/wiki/Giants" title="Giants">Giants</a>: previous episodes occasionally referred to them in the context of being mythical creatures, but this episode confirms that they are a real race which survives beyond the Wall. In the novels giants are described as being more apelike, forsaking clothes as they are covered in shaggy fur. </li> <li>When Cersei meets Tyrion for the first time after the battle, she says she heard he had lost his nose, but the scar across his face isn't as gruesome as that. In the books, Tyrion did indeed have the front his nose cut off when Ser Mandon Moore attempted to kill him. The TV series decided not to do this as it would have been difficult and expensive to achieve the effect and it would have limited Peter Dinklage's acting performance. </li> <li>There is significant construction work underway in King's Landing, with scaffolding surrounding towers along the walls. The reasons for this are unclear, given that such construction work is not present in the books. It is possible this is meant to show repairs being underway to the city following the battle, even though during the battle there was no indication of King's Landing suffering an artillery bombardment. </li> <li>Robb mentions that "the Lannisters have been running from us since <a href="/wiki/Oxcross" title="Oxcross">Oxcross</a>." This is the first time that the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Oxcross" title="Battle of Oxcross">Battle of Oxcross</a> has actually been referred to by name on-screen. The battle occurred in the fourth episode of Season 2, "<a href="/wiki/Garden_of_Bones" title="Garden of Bones">Garden of Bones</a>," but up until this point <i>Game of Thrones Wiki</i> has been conjecturally referring to it as the "Battle of Oxcross" based on information from the books. This confirms that the location of the battle was unchanged in the TV continuity. </li> <li>The new strategy the Lannisters are using post-Oxcross is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_strategy" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Fabian strategy">Fabian strategy</a> in real-life, so-named after the Roman general Fabius Maximus Cunctator. After the Carthaginian general Hannibal destroyed the Roman army at Cannae in 216 B.C., the Roman Senate finally realized that it would be all but impossible to defeat Hannibal in a pitched battle. Instead, they wasted no resources on attempts to give battle, falling back and harassing Hannibal's forces to wear down his supplies. </li> <li>Bronn dismissively tells Ser Meryn Trant that he is more skilled at beating helpless girls than at fighting real men; Meryn publicly beat Sansa Stark in front of the entire court, also in "Garden of Bones." </li> <li>Tywin Lannister says that three out of the Seven Kingdoms are in open rebellion. The North and the Iron Islands are clearly in revolt, but it isn't clear if he is counting the Riverlands as the third kingdom, or considering them an extension of the North, in which case the third "kingdom" is the Stormlands under Stannis. Tywin might consider Stannis such a spent force that he doesn't counter the Stormlands as in "open rebellion" anymore. After the Battle of the Blackwater, several of the Stormlords are captured and bend the knee, leaving Stannis only Storm's End and some of the Lords of the Narrow Sea that remain loyal to him. <ul><li>The <i>HBO Go</i> Interactive Features confirms that Tywin means The North, the Iron Islands, and the Stormlands (Stannis, even if he's been driven back to Dragonstone), as three different rebel factions. Thus he generally refers Robb's entire domain, which he claims as both the North and the Riverlands, as "the North." It is also possible that Tywin didn't include the Riverlands as a "Kingdom" as historically it was part of the Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers, having been conquered by the ironborn. </li></ul> </li> <li>When Tyrion asks for at least some gratitude for his vital role in the defense of the city during the Battle of the Blackwater, his father Tywin bluntly brushes his request aside by saying that Lannisters don't do things to earn rewards. However, Tywin himself arranged for Joffrey to award him with the made-up title of "<a href="/wiki/Savior_of_the_City" title="Savior of the City">Savior of the City</a>" as a reward for his role in the same battle. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Balerion_(ship)" title="Balerion (ship)">The ship that Daenerys sails in</a> was actually a re-use of a prop ship designed and built by <a href="/wiki/Gemma_Jackson" title="Gemma Jackson">Gemma Jackson</a>'s production team for <a href="/wiki/Season_2" title="Season 2">Season 2</a>, which appeared on fire during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blackwater" title="Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</a>. The series actually only has one prop-boat (as they are quite expensive) which they redress to represent every scene taking place on a ship in the TV series, i.e., the same prop ship was also <i><a href="/wiki/Fury" title="Fury">Fury</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Betha" title="Black Betha">Black Betha</a></i> in the Battle of the Blackwater. The ship was constructed in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, and it wouldn't have made sense to move it for scenes entirely set on the ship, so all of Daenerys' scenes on the ship were filmed in Northern Ireland. This makes it the only scene <a href="/wiki/Emilia_Clarke" title="Emilia Clarke">Emilia Clarke</a> filmed in Northern Ireland instead of Morocco for Season 3.
