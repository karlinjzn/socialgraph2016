Sam attempts to interrogate Jon about what it was like to be with a woman, stating that as their deaths are looming, it may be his last chance to find out. Sam brings up that the vows of the Night's Watch only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children, and that other "activities" are open to interpretation. Jon replies glumly that <a href="/wiki/Alliser_Thorne" title="Alliser Thorne">Alliser Thorne</a> most likely does not care about their interpretations. When further pressed by Sam to describe lying down with Ygritte, Jon attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it, proclaiming exasperatedly that he's "not a bleeding poet." <p>Jon offers to take the watch up alone so Sam can go below. As Sam steps into the wooden lift and begins to descend the Wall, an owl lands on top of the wall and begins hooting loudly. The owl is revealed to be controlled by a <a href="/wiki/Thenn_Warg" title="Thenn Warg" class="mw-redirect">Thenn warg</a> who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of Tormund and Styr, who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to Castle Black. Tormund boasts about a bear he supposedly had sex with, prompting Ygritte to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim. She tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of "<a href="/wiki/Night%27s_Watch" title="Night's Watch">crows</a>" as possible. She angrily talks about how the people south of <a href="/wiki/The_Wall" title="The Wall">the Wall</a> have used it to shut the the wildlings out and hunt them as enemies. She says that now the wildlings are the hunters and the southerners their prey. Styr mockingly replies that Ygritte has more words about killing than she has arrows. She defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at <a href="/wiki/Mole%27s_Town" title="Mole's Town">Mole's Town</a> as he, but Styr replies that none of them was her former lover. He further mocks her by saying that when she sees him, she'll likely just serve him a slice of "ginger minge," causing her to jump to her feet in anger. Ygritte stares Styr down, claiming that she wants to kill Jon Snow herself, then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to kill him. Just outside the camp, a <a href="/wiki/Gilly" title="Gilly">shaded person</a> cradling <a href="/wiki/Sam" title="Sam">something</a> passes by the wildlings unnoticed. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":4}' data-ref="4"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e1/Aemon_in_library.png/revision/latest?cb=20160805005518"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Aemon in library.png" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/e1/Aemon_in_library.png/revision/latest?cb=20160805005518" alt="Aemon in library.png" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Maester Aemon finds Sam in the Castle Black library.</figcaption></figure>​Meanwhile, Sam is caught reading a book about wildlings by Maester <a href="/wiki/Aemon" title="Aemon">Aemon</a>. Aemon correctly guesses that Sam is reading the book because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen <a href="/wiki/Gilly" title="Gilly">Gilly</a> if she fell into wildling hands during the <a href="/wiki/Sack_of_Mole%27s_Town" title="Sack of Mole's Town">sack</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mole%27s_Town" title="Mole's Town">Mole's Town</a>.

However, Sam roars at Pyp to allow her in, causing Pyp to relent and let her in. Sam promises Gilly wherever she goes next he will go too, but their reunion is cut short by two blows from the horn, indicating that Mance's wildling army has finally begun their assault. Sam rushes to get Gilly safely inside the castle while other brothers of the Night's Watch prepare for the impending attack by wildlings. <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/da/S04E09_-_Jon_%28On_the_Wall%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20160723031842"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201165%20732'%2F%3E" alt="S04E09 - Jon (On the Wall).png" width="1165" height="732"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/da/S04E09_-_Jon_%28On_the_Wall%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20160723031842" alt="S04E09 - Jon (On the Wall).png" width="1165" height="732"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Jon looking off the top of the Wall.</figcaption></figure><p>On top of the Wall, Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north, witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North, just as Mance had promised.

As Sam and Pypar are preparing arrows at the southern gate, Pypar laments that he has never seen a real battle before or ever even held an edged blade. Pyp asks how Sam is not afraid, but Sam replies that he is, as there are thousands of wildlings about to overrun them. Pyp asks how he managed to kill a <a href="/wiki/White_Walker_(Valar_Morghulis)" title="White Walker (Valar Morghulis)">White Walker</a> while being afraid, and Sam says that at that moment, he just had to do something or Gilly would have been killed and her baby would have been taken.

She tells the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the Wall and that few are left in the Castle. The group immediately take off towards Castle Black's southern gate, while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts. North of the Wall, the massive wildling army emerges from the woods, their numbers including <a href="/wiki/Giants" title="Giants">giants</a> riding atop <a href="/wiki/Mammoths" title="Mammoths">mammoths</a>. Alliser orders the archers on the Wall to nock their arrows, but they draw instead while <a href="/wiki/Grenn" title="Grenn">Grenn</a> accidentally drops a barrel down the Wall. Alliser angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at Castle Black, signalling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at the castle's southern entrance. Realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack, Alliser orders <a href="/wiki/Janos_Slynt" title="Janos Slynt">Janos Slynt</a> to assume command of the Wall's defenses and heads below to join the melee. </p> <p>Below, Tormund and Styr's forces charge the gate while Ygritte, acting as a sniper, manages to pick off several men defending the gate with her bow. Pyp is firing a crossbow as Sam assists by reloading another crossbow, but Pyp's aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves so he repeatedly misses his shots. The band of wildlings manage to reach Castle Black's walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes, forcing Sam and Pyp to retreat. </p> <p>Alliser Thorne arrives with reinforcements from the top of the Wall via the wooden lift system, which is being operated by <a href="/wiki/Olly" title="Olly">Olly</a>. Alliser gives an impassioned speech, promising that the ancient order of the Night's Watch and Castle Black will survive this battle. His speech rallies the black brothers and Alliser personally leads the charge against the wildlings who have breached Castle Black's defenses, causing an intense battle to erupt in the courtyard. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":8}' data-ref="8"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/56/Mammth.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20140609174732"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20400%20266'%2F%3E" alt="Mammth.jpeg" width="400" height="266"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/56/Mammth.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20140609174732" alt="Mammth.jpeg" width="400" height="266"> </noscript> </a> </figure>​​On the northern side of the Wall, a wildling strike force led by two giants (<a href="/wiki/Mag_Mar_Tun_Doh_Weg" title="Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg">one</a> of which is riding a mammoth) charge towards Castle Black's outer gate. On top of the Wall, Janos Slynt, having no true leadership experience, breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders. Grenn steps in by falsely claiming that Alliser needs Janos back down below.

Styr picks Jon up and begins strangling him, but Jon spits blood in Styr's face and distracts him long enough for Jon to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and buries it in Styr's skull. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":13}' data-ref="13"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/40/Ygritte_dies.png/revision/latest?cb=20160719042121"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20762'%2F%3E" alt="Ygritte dies.png" width="1366" height="762"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/40/Ygritte_dies.png/revision/latest?cb=20160719042121" alt="Ygritte dies.png" width="1366" height="762"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Jon holds a dying Ygritte.</figcaption></figure>Upon killing Styr, Jon turns around to find Ygritte pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn. He smiles at her, causing Ygritte to hesitate. Before either can say anything, Ygritte is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from Olly, avenging the death of his father at Ygritte's hands during the wildling attack on his village. Jon holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have never left the cave, and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound. <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":14}' data-ref="14"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0a/Tormund_capture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140612013049"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201024%20576'%2F%3E" alt="Tormund capture.jpg" width="1024" height="576"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0a/Tormund_capture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140612013049" alt="Tormund capture.jpg" width="1024" height="576"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Tormund makes a last stand before he is subdued by Jon and the Night's Watch.</figcaption></figure>Atop the Wall, <a href="/wiki/Eddison_Tollett" title="Eddison Tollett">Eddison Tollett</a>, who Jon left in command of the defenses, orders the men to drop the 'scythe.' A huge section of ice suddenly falls away from the wall revealing a massive anchor-like blade attached to a chain that swings along the Wall, mowing through the wildlings attempting to climb its face. Eddison notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the <a href="/wiki/Haunted_Forest" title="Haunted Forest">Haunted Forest</a>, proclaiming that they have stopped them for now, but that the wildlings still outnumber the black brothers 1,000 to 1 and that Mance was simply testing their defenses.

He is finally subdued by Jon with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the Night's Watch for interrogation. Sam returns to Gilly just like he promised and discovers Janos Slynt, who hid in fear during the entire battle. Against all odds, the Night's Watch have repelled Mance Rayder's forces for the time being. <p>The following morning, what is left of Castle Black's garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by Mance Rayder. Jon discusses with Sam that he has a suicidal solution to end the wildling threat; he plans to assassinate Mance Rayder, noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army, and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership. Sam tries to talk sense into Jon, but to no avail. As Jon prepares to leave via Castle Black's tunnel, they discover the bodies of the black brothers who held the inner gate against the giant. Grenn is among the casualties and Jon tells Sam that all of the bodies must be burned. Before Jon leaves, he remembers the promise he made to <a href="/wiki/Jeor_Mormont" title="Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</a> and decides to leave <a href="/wiki/Longclaw" title="Longclaw">Longclaw</a> with Sam. Sam tells Jon to come back, and Jon looks at Sam and smiles dolefully before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the gate. </p> <h2 id="Appearances" section="3">Appearances</h2>

the words of the oath sworn by new recruits into the <a href="/wiki/Night%27s_Watch" title="Night's Watch">Night's Watch</a>, which include the lines: <i>"I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.</i>" </li> <li>Much like "Blackwater," which focused exclusively on King's Landing during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blackwater" title="Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</a>, this episode focuses entirely on events in or around <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a> during the wildling assault, and no other storylines appear. This makes it only the third episode in the entire series that doesn't contain a single scene in King's Landing (after Season I's "<a href="/wiki/The_Kingsroad" title="The Kingsroad">The Kingsroad</a>" and Season 3's "<a href="/wiki/The_Rains_of_Castamere_(episode)" title="The Rains of Castamere (episode)">The Rains of Castamere</a>"). </li> <li>As a result, King's Landing, Moat Cailin, Winterfell, Braavos, and Meereen do not appear in this episode despite being featured in the opening sequence.​ </li> <li>The episode is directed by <a href="/wiki/Neil_Marshall" title="Neil Marshall">Neil Marshall</a>, who previously directed the critically acclaimed <a href="/wiki/Season_2" title="Season 2">season 2</a> episode "<a href="/wiki/Blackwater" title="Blackwater">Blackwater</a>." In an interview with <i>BuzzFeed</i>, Marshall made several comments about the episode:<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup><ul> <li>From start to finish, Marshall had nine weeks to complete the episode, with four weeks devoted solely to pre-production (compared to the seven days of pre-production on "Blackwater"). Marshall said, "I definitely needed it this time." The additional weeks were devoted to planning out the battle, conceptualizing the CGI mammoths, and choreographing the 360 degree crane shot of Castle Black during the battle. </li> <li>There was a three week shoot for the episode, of which two weeks were for the battle scenes (unsurprisingly; the actual battle takes up 31 minutes of the 55 minute long episode). </li> <li>The <a href="/wiki/Mammoths" title="Mammoths">Mammoths</a> were introduced for the first time in this episode, and Marshall said that he wanted to get the mammoth's look just right: "The mammoth, we just wanted to look as huge and authentic as possible. I know that the creators of the show wouldn't allow anything less than a 100% convincing mammoth. I'm very grateful for having such brilliant VFX supervisors around to make sure it was going to work. And it so did! Given that these scenes involved multiple elements — the live-action plates, the giants (real eight-foot tall guys shot against green screen), and the mammoth itself, 100% CGI — making sure when you add these elements together they line up correctly...these were easily the most complex scenes I’ve ever shot." Marshall explained that a huge green screen stood in for the mammoth on set, and that it was "moved by four guys in green Lyrca suits at each of its legs" – to ensure that none of the actors crossed its path. Marshall shot the rehearsal takes with the men in green suits as a reference, then shot the exact same action without the green frame, just the empty space, which the CGI mammoth would be composited into." </li> <li>The 360 degree shot of the battle in the castle took two hours to block (position all of the actors) and rehearse. It took seven takes to get it done perfectly. Marshall decided to do the 360 degree shot because Castle Black is a fully realized set, which made it perfectly suited for such a shot. Marshall said, "As soon as I saw the set for the first time I knew I wanted to pull off a 360 shot — the set and action were just screaming for it. So I devised a shot that would visually link all the major characters and clearly establish where they were at this particular point in the battle. I think geography is vitally important in a action sequence. It's all too easy to lose a sense of where characters are in the blaze of quick cuts and physical action. Having a shot like this that binds all the characters and their actions together really helps the audience understand what's happening, so they remain involved in the scene. We blocked the shot and rehearsed for about an hour or two, then got it in seven takes. Once we pulled off the 360 shot, the entire crew gave themselves and each other a big round of applause, and it was well deserved. It's such a great cast and crew regardless, but for that particular shot it was like everyone — from the stuntmen and extras to the crane operators to the assistant directors — understood what we were trying to achieve and were absolutely at the top of their game that evening. That nobody got hit by the camera, which was sweeping past their heads at incredible speed, was a miracle in itself. But everyone had their timing and moves down to perfection and that’s why it only took seven takes. That was a great moment." </li> <li>Marshall explained how they filmed "the scythe" at the end of the battle (which is not in the books but an invention of the TV series): "The scythe was very similar to the mammoth in that it was 100% CGI. I shot all the live action elements — the man releasing the scythe mechanism, the wildlings on the wall about to be struck by it — but all the actual scythe shots were created in the computer. And beautifully realized they were too." </li> <li>Of filming Ygritte's death scene, Marshall said, "I had to overcome the issue of these two characters having such a painful and intimate scene within the context of a battle. I achieved this by using slo-motion — one of the very few times it's been used in Game of Thrones, one of the other times being the file of my previous episode, "Blackwater" — in order to visually and aurally force the battle into the background, leaving them almost trapped in this moment, allowing it to play out in a more poignant manner and pack a more powerful dramatic punch." </li> </ul> </li> <li>As she is dying in his arms, Ygritte tells Jon Snow that she wishes they could have stayed in that cave, where they made love, back in Season 3 episode 5 "<a href="/wiki/Kissed_by_Fire" title="Kissed by Fire">Kissed by Fire</a>." At the time, Ygritte and Jon were bathing together in a hot spring and she said she wished they could stay there forever and hold onto that moment – instead of having to go back outside to a world filled with wars and the conflict between the Night's Watch and wildlings. </li> <li>As the writers note in the Inside the Episode featurette, Ygritte's death in Jon's arms is one of the few times that the TV series has used slow motion: they try to use it sparingly because it can be cheesy if overused, but they felt that this was one of the right moments for it. As they explain, the slow motion allows the camera to show Jon's subjective point of view: the battle is raging all around him, but all of that has faded away from his attention and time slows to a crawl as his beloved Ygritte dies. The sounds of the battle are also muted, to show that all of Jon's focus is on Ygritte. To aid this effect, actress Rose Leslie came in for A.D.R. to re-record all of her lines - that way the audio technicians had an entirely clean recording, without any other sounds from the battle, and every little breath, whimper, and effort Ygritte makes after she is shot can be heard. Normally the camera could barely register these sounds, but the scene has switched to Jon's personal perspective and he is holding Ygritte, so he does hear this.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> </li> <li>At the San Diego Comic-Con 2014 panel, Rose Leslie said that Ygritte's death scene was also the last scene she filmed for the TV series – and that she was thankful for this, because the scene was so emotionally draining that it would have been difficult to subsequently come back and film scenes from earlier episodes in the season.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> </li> <li>In the Inside the Episode Guide video, writers Benioff and Weiss acknowledge that in the novels, <a href="/wiki/Pypar" title="Pypar">Pypar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grenn" title="Grenn">Grenn</a> actually don't die in the Battle of Castle Black (and are still alive as of the current, fifth novel). Pypar's death has no counterpart in the books. Grenn's heroic sacrifice stopping the giant from breaching the tunnel-gate was performed by Donal Noye in the books, a one-armed blacksmith who once served the Baratheons. Many other minor Night's Watch characters also die during the battle in the books. Benioff and Weiss explained that they wanted to show the real cost of the battle and for it to have dramatic impact, which meant they had to kill a few named recurring characters (instead of nameless background extras, which would carry no dramatic weight). Due to the time constraints of adaptation, the TV series has only been able to focus on and develop a limited number of Watch members, never even introducing Donal Noye, while Pyp and Grenn are characters that the audience has grown attached to. </li> <li>In the books, Jon warned <a href="/wiki/Mole%27s_Town" title="Mole's Town">Mole's Town</a> about the advanced wildling raiding parties south of the Wall, so most of its inhabitants fled to Castle Black before they arrived. The Night's Watch was so badly outnumbered that they let any of the refugees who were strong enough to fire a bow or crossbow join in the defense, including several of the whores from the brothel. One prostitute named Zei turned out to be a good shot with a crossbow. In the TV series, Mole's Town was <a href="/wiki/Sack_of_Mole%27s_Town" title="Sack of Mole's Town">taken by surprise</a> and most of its inhabitants were killed, with Gilly as the only survivor who manages to reach Castle Black – though in the books Gilly never went to Mole's Town but stayed at Castle Black. Mole's Town is located only half a league (about two miles) south of Castle Black, so it is entirely plausible that Gilly could reach the Wall by simply walking for several hours in a single night. </li> <li>When Samwell kisses Gilly, <a href="/wiki/Hannah_Murray" title="Hannah Murray">Hannah Murray</a> deliberately decided not to passionately kiss <a href="/wiki/John_Bradley" title="John Bradley" class="mw-redirect">John Bradley</a> back, but for her reaction to be a mixture of surprise and confusion. Murray's reasoning was that in all probability, <a href="/wiki/Craster" title="Craster">Craster</a> never kissed any of his "wives": neither his daughter-wife Gilly, nor any of the older "wives", including her mother. Craster also jealously guarded his wives and they had no contact with the world outside of <a href="/wiki/Craster%27s_Keep" title="Craster's Keep">Craster's Keep</a>, not even with other wildlings. Logically, Murray concluded, Gilly has never been kissed before (romantically, on the mouth), nor even <i>seen</i> other people kissing romantically before she fled Craster's Keep<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> </li> <li>Maester Aemon revealed to Jon Snow in Season 1 episode 9 "<a href="/wiki/Baelor" title="Baelor">Baelor</a>" that he was actually born Aemon Targaryen, and is a long-forgotten uncle of the Mad King. He was the son of King <a href="/wiki/Maekar_Targaryen" title="Maekar Targaryen">Maekar Targaryen</a> and grew up as a prince in the royal court. This episode reveals that he also told Samwell at some point, off-screen. Given that Samwell is one of the few well-educated (or even literate) members of the garrison at Castle Black he was appointed as Aemon's steward sending and receiving messages in the ravenry – so given how closely he works with Aemon it is entirely plausible that he explained it to him at some point. In the books, Samwell is aware at this point that Aemon is a Targaryen, though it wasn't made clear if Jon or Aemon himself told Sam. Aemon reiterates to Samwell the warning he gave to Jon in "Baelor" (explicitly saying that he said this to Jon before): that the greatest threat to duty is love, and he should remember that he has taken a vow to the Night's Watch. </li> <li>Maester <a href="/wiki/Aemon" title="Aemon">Aemon</a>'s story to Samwell about his past is an invention of the TV series: he says that as a young man many girls threw themselves at him, because he was a royal prince, and that one even succeeded, and he still remembers his lost love very clearly. This has led to some fan speculation that this girl was actually <a href="/wiki/Olenna_Tyrell" title="Olenna Tyrell">Olenna Tyrell</a> (known by her maiden name Olenna Redwyne at the time), particularly because Olenna remarked to Margaery back in Season 4 episode 4 "<a href="/wiki/Oathkeeper" title="Oathkeeper">Oathkeeper</a>" that she had once been engaged to a Targaryen, but didn't like him and seduced <a href="/wiki/Luthor_Tyrell" title="Luthor Tyrell">Luthor Tyrell</a> to get out of it. Olenna <i>does</i> mention in the books that she was engaged to marry a Targaryen in her youth but did everything she could to avoid the match: in both versions she doesn't say what his name was, though the anecdote about sexually seducing Luthor is an added detail for the TV show (though this could have happened). The possibility that the girl was Olenna, however, would contain several contradictions: first, Olenna said she didn't like the Targaryen she was betrothed to and actively evaded their union, while Aemon says the girl in his past threw herself at him. Second, Maester Aemon is about <i>thirty years</i> older than Olenna. While there is always some chance that the TV series would drastically change the chronology (it did make Aemon the Mad King's uncle instead of his great-uncle), the age difference is quite drastic: in the books, Aemon began training at the Citadel when he was around 9 years old, became a full Maester when he was 19, and then joined the Night's Watch when he was around 35 years old in 233 AL - roughly around the same time that Olenna Redwyne was <i>born</i>. The TV series's anecdote also ignores the fact that Aemon was in training as a maester since he was 9 and would thus have been ineligible for marriage from a young age - though there are numerous examples in history of maesters being seduced (such as Pycelle), and ultimately Aemon <i>could</i> have been released from his vows and challenged his younger brother to become king himself, but in the end he chose not to. So it is possible that women threw themselves at the young Aemon even knowing he was a maester, perhaps hoping he would one day be released from his vows (and very nearly was). <ul><li>The <i>World of Ice and Fire</i> sourcebook (2014) revealed that Olenna was actually engaged to marry Aemon's <i>nephew</i> - however, the TV series removed that entire generation of House Targaryen to make Aerys II the Mad King the direct son of Aemon's younger brother Aegon V (when in the novels he was has grandson), so it isn't really clear who Olenna was engaged to in the TV continuity. </li></ul> </li> <li>Jon Snow gained the edge on Styr during the last moment of their fight by spitting blood in his face, giving Jon the moment he needed to grab a hammer and bring it down into Styr's skull. This is roughly the same trick that <a href="/wiki/Karl_Tanner" title="Karl Tanner">Karl Tanner</a> used against Jon at Craster's Keep in "<a href="/wiki/First_of_His_Name" title="First of His Name">First of His Name</a>," nearly killing him. </li> <li>In an interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, writers Benioff and Weiss gave some details about the new sets built to show more of the top of the Wall in this episode: </li> </ul> <dl><dd><dl> <dd>Benioff: "In terms of the sets, our new production designer <a href="/wiki/Deborah_Riley" title="Deborah Riley">Deborah Riley</a> did this magnificent top-of-The Wall set, far bigger than what we had before, so you can do walk-and-talks, you can have massive action sequences. It's completely surrounded by green screen, which is apparently the biggest green screen in Europe." </dd> <dd>Weiss: "Neil and Deb both spent a lot of time watching the Kubrick film <i>Paths of Glory</i> to get a sense of how to apply trench warfare set-building to an icy top-of-the Wall environment. She did a really fantastic job. It has to be the biggest Styrofoam piece in existence.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup> </dd> </dl></dd></dl> <ul> <li>At the end of the episode, Jon and Samwell find the aftermath of the fight between the giant Mag the Mighty and the six black brothers led by Grenn, which neither Grenn and his men nor the giant survived. Curiously, the bars of the gate are bent <i>outwards</i>, despite the fact that when when last seen, the giant was charging to try to bash the gate <i>inwards</i>. This might be a mistake, but then again, the camera cuts away before we see how Mag ultimately managed to force his way through the gate, so it is possible that he eventually tried to pry it apart. </li> <li>The Season 4 blooper reel revealed that during the fight between Styr and Jon Snow, in one take when Styr misses Jon and embeds his ax into a wooden weapons rack (which was rigged to break), the axe got stuck on the wood anyway, and actor Yuri Kolokolnikov struggles for a few moments to get it off.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[7]</a></sup> Another blooper reel revealed that when <a href="/wiki/Owen_Teale" title="Owen Teale">Owen Teale</a> (Alliser Thorne) was fighting in the courtyard, he struck his prop-sword against a stuntman's shield so hard that the blade of the prop-sword snapped off completely at the hilt.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[8]</a></sup> </li> <li>When the <a href="/wiki/Thenn_warg" title="Thenn warg">Thenn warg</a>'s owl lands on top of the Wall to spy on the defenses, the actor-owl refused to land on its mark. After a full two hours of attempts, Neil Marshall was on the verge of giving up and resorting to using a CGI owl for the shot, but then the actor-owl finally got the mark correctly.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup> </li> <li>When <a href="/wiki/Dongo" title="Dongo">one of the giants</a> chases after the mammoth and is shot in the back by a ballista bolt, the way he falls down when he dies is an homage to the famous scene in the 1971 film <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_(film)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:The French Connection (film)">The French Connection</a></i>, when Gene Hackman's character shoots the hitman Nicoli.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup> </li> <li>When flaming oil barrels are dropped on the team of wildlings handling the mammoth, neither the wildlings nor the flames were digitally added. Instead, stuntmen were <i>actually</i> set on fire - protected by their heavy layers of clothing and their exposed skin covered in gel, they were really on fire for a few seconds, then the moment that the director called "cut!", crewmembers scrambled to put out the flames with fire extinguishers before the stuntmen could be seriously hurt. Even the flaming wildling who gets caught up in the ropes and gets dragged along the ground by the panicking mammoth was a practical effect: the stuntman was pulled along the ground by a rope attached to a truck. They made sure that the rope was positioned high on the truck, to match the height of where the rope would be attached to the mammoth's shoulders.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[11]</a></sup> </li> <li>To portray the giant <a href="/wiki/Mag_Mar_Tun_Doh_Weg" title="Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg">Mag the Mighty</a> charging through the ice tunnel, the production team built a smaller half-scale replica of the tunnel. Therefore when the 7 foot tall stunt actor charged through the 8 foot half-scale tunnel, the perspective made him look like he was a 14 foot high giant charging through a 16 foot high tunnel. The shots of the giant on his side of the tunnel and Grenn's men on the other side of the gate were then matched up digitally.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[12]</a></sup> </li> </ul> <h2 id="In_the_books" section="10">In the books</h2> <dl><dd> <i>See: <a href="/wiki/Differences_between_books_and_TV_series_-_Season_4#The_Watchers_on_the_Wall" title="Differences between books and TV series - Season 4">Differences between books and TV series - Season 4#The_Watchers_on_the_Wall</a></i> </dd></dl> <ul><li> The episode is adapted from the following chapters of <i>A Storm of Swords</i>: <ul> <li> Chapter 55, Jon VII: The <a href="/wiki/Wildling" title="Wildling" class="mw-redirect">wildling</a> scouts with whom <a href="/wiki/Jon" title="Jon">Jon</a> climbed the <a href="/wiki/Wall" title="Wall" class="mw-redirect">Wall</a> attack <a href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a> from the South. <a href="/wiki/Styr" title="Styr">Styr</a> is killed in the fight. <a href="/wiki/Ygritte" title="Ygritte">Ygritte</a> is shot through the chest with an arrow, and she dies in Jon's arms. </li> <li> Chapter 64, Jon VIII: <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a>'s army attacks from the <a href="/wiki/Beyond_the_Wall" title="Beyond the Wall">North</a>.
