Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old <a href="/wiki/House_Targaryen" title="House Targaryen">Targaryen</a> practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night, when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei's bed and called her <i>"<a href="/wiki/Lyanna_Stark" title="Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</a>"</i>.

Instead, Eddard gives Ser Barristan Selmy the proclamation naming him as Lord Protector of the Realm. To Barristan's shock, Cersei takes the "paper shield" and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that Eddard bend the knee and swear allegiance. In return he will be allowed to return to Winterfell. Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody. Instead, the City Watch kill Eddard's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat, saying, "I did warn you not to trust me." </p> <h2 id="Appearances" section="8">Appearances</h2> <dl><dd>

take their names from Cersei's phrase "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die". </li> <li> The revelation that Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are not Robert's children means that Robert's younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a>, is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Stannis appears in the <a href="/wiki/Season_2" title="Season 2">second season</a>. </li> <li> The establishing shots of the Lannister camp, at 3:28, show <a href="/wiki/Timett" title="Timett">Timett</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chella" title="Chella">Chella</a> in error. The footage was taken from scenes shot for the next episode, "<a href="/wiki/The_Pointy_End" title="The Pointy End">The Pointy End</a>". </li> <li> The stag shown being skinned by Charles Dance (as Tywin Lannister) was real. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as Jaime Lannister) enjoys venison, and he hoped that, after the scene, the stag could be sent to Craft Services, but that didn't happen. The books never portray Tywin Lannister skinning a stag. The books do introduce another character this way—Lord <a href="/wiki/Randyll_Tarly" title="Randyll Tarly">Randyll Tarly</a>, Samwell Tarly's father, who is doing this in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> during a flashback in which Sam tells Jon Snow about how his father made him join the Night's Watch. Randyll Tarly had yet to be cast when this scene was filmed, so the show's writers gave this introduction to Tywin Lannister. </li> <li> To date, this is one of only six episodes in which <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> has not appeared. The other five are "<a href="/wiki/The_Rains_of_Castamere" title="The Rains of Castamere">The Rains of Castamere</a>", "<a href="/wiki/First_of_His_Name" title="First of His Name">First of His Name</a>", "<a href="/wiki/The_Watchers_on_the_Wall" title="The Watchers on the Wall">The Watchers on the Wall</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Blood_of_My_Blood" title="Blood of My Blood">Blood of My Blood</a>", and "<a href="/wiki/The_Broken_Man" title="The Broken Man">The Broken Man</a>". </li> <li> In the book, Eddard does not send Stannis a letter telling him that he is the rightful heir. The letter is written, but intercepted. Stannis already suspected that the children were not Robert's, as he was investigating it with Jon Arryn. Since Arryn's death, Stannis has been building his forces on Dragonstone. </li> <li> Lord Baelish never could support Stannis's claim to the throne. Stannis has despised Littlefinger ever since Littlefinger protected City Watch Commander <a href="/wiki/Janos_Slynt" title="Janos Slynt">Janos Slynt</a> from prosecution and dismissal, after the discovery that Slynt was receiving bribes. Stannis is a strict adherent to law and order, and he has banned prostitution on Dragonstone, so Petyr Baelish's livelihood would end if Stannis came to power. </li> <li>The scene between Tywin and Jaime, and the scene between Theon, Osha, and Maester Luwin, were written at the last minute because the rough cut of the episode was running short. Both scenes were filmed in post-production reshoots, and they contain only interior shots which didn't need to be filmed on location.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> </li> </ul> <h2 id="In_the_books" section="14">In the books</h2> <dl><dd> <i>See: <a href="/wiki/Differences_between_books_and_TV_series_-_Season_1#You_Win_or_You_Die" title="Differences between books and TV series - Season 1">Differences between books and TV series - Season 1#You Win or You Die</a> </i> </dd></dl> <ul><li> The episode is adapted from the following chapters of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>: <ul> <li> Chapter 45, Eddard XII. </li> <li> Chapter 47, Eddard XIII. </li> <li> Chapter 48, Jon VI. </li> <li> Chapter 49, Eddard XIV. </li> <li> Chapter 54, Daenerys VI. </li> </ul> </li></ul> <h2 id="Memorable_quotes" section="15">Memorable quotes</h2> <p><b><a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a></b>: "Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
