Desperately running across the ramparts, she is caught by <a href="/wiki/Myranda" title="Myranda">Myranda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Reek</a>. Myranda threatens Sansa with a bow, however Sansa, weary and realizing she can't escape a shot from a bow, tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left. Myranda tells Sansa that Ramsay needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards, but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that. Sansa braces herself for the worst as Myrnada tenses her bow, as Theon finally breaks the Bolton's hold on him and causes Myranda to misfire, then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts, where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. Sansa and Theon run, but with Ramsay just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart. </p> <h3 id="In_Braavos" section="4"> In Braavos </h3> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":4}' data-ref="4"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1c/Arya-kills-Trant-S05E10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150616103436"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%202100%201397'%2F%3E" alt="Arya-kills-Trant-S05E10.jpg" width="2100" height="1397"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1c/Arya-kills-Trant-S05E10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150616103436" alt="Arya-kills-Trant-S05E10.jpg" width="2100" height="1397"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Arya kills Meryn Trant</figcaption></figure>Ser <a href="/wiki/Meryn_Trant" title="Meryn Trant">Meryn Trant</a> is looking upon three young girls in the <a href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavosi</a> brothel.

The HBO Viewer's Guide simply identifies him as <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a>, the Mountain That Rides, after Qyburn's experimentation on him (healing him from his poisoning by <a href="/wiki/Manticores" title="Manticores">manticore</a> venom). In the novels, Gregor is <i>reported</i> to have died and Qyburn sent a huge skull to Dorne which could only have belonged to Gregor - or at least, this is what is believed. Several characters within the narrative (such as Cersei's uncle Kevan) strongly suspect that it actually is Gregor - not just healed, but risen from the dead through Qyburn's use of necromancy. It isn't even clear if "Robert Strong" has a head, because he wears a visored helmet (the TV version still left prominent eye-holes, probably because it would be too difficult for the stunt man to use a more restrictive helmet). </li> <li>The TV series shifted around the identities and deaths of several people on <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a>'s kill list, particularly several soldiers under Gregor Clegane's command at Harrenhal, some of which were adapted out. These include <a href="/wiki/Polliver" title="Polliver">Polliver</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Tickler" title="The Tickler">The Tickler</a>, and another soldier called Raff the Sweetling (his nickname is sarcastic due to his cruelty). It was Raff and not Polliver who killed <a href="/wiki/Lommy_Greenhands" title="Lommy Greenhands" class="mw-redirect">Lommy Greenhands</a>. Meryn Trant is still on her list, but he doesn't go to Braavos and is still alive in the novels. Arya and <a href="/wiki/Sandor_Clegane" title="Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</a> ran into Polliver and the Tickler at an inn, where Sandor killed Polliver, and Arya killed the Tickler in a frenzy, repeatedly stabbing him after he fell and becoming smeared with his blood. Raff went to Braavos as a guard for the Master of Coin sent to treat with the Iron Bank. Raff in the novels is interested in perversely young girls, and Arya does attempt to seduce him - but them stabs him and sadistically repeats the words Raff taunted Lommy with, making him beg her to carry him before killing him. She doesn't need to steal a Faceless Man mask because Raff doesn't recognize her (she is much older and dressed differently than when they last met and she was disguised as a boy - though Meryn knew Arya much better than Raff, from her time in the Red Keep, so it makes sense that she would need a disguise for him in the TV series). <ul> <li>Actor <a href="/wiki/Ian_Beattie" title="Ian Beattie">Ian Beattie</a> (Meryn) said that he started to suspect that Arya was going to kill off his character as soon as he got the script for the fourth episode of Season 5, and learned that Meryn was heading to Braavos, because Beattie knew that Arya was already there.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> </li> <li>While Raff in the novels <i>was</i> interested in underaged girls, he never <i>beats</i> brothel girls with a stick, apparently to test them out, the way that Meryn does in this episode. Retroactively this might give more sadistic implications to Meryn beating up Sansa at Joffrey's command back in Seasons 2 and 3, Beattie acknowledged, but he also said he wasn't aware they were going to condense these elements of Raff's character into his back then - apparently the condensation was only decided on in Season 5 or maybe in Season 4 - so he didn't play his scenes with Sansa like that (just that Meryn blindly follows orders, no matter how ridiculous).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup> </li> <li>In the TV version, Jaqen killed the Tickler while still at Harrenhal. Polliver was killed in a fight with Sandor and Arya at an inn, but Arya taunted him the way she did Raff when she killed him in the novels. Killing Meryn Trant in this episode takes the place of how she killed Raff when she stumbled upon him in Braavos, while trying to seduce him despite her young age, though the <i>manner</i> in which she kills him is reminiscent of how she brutally killed the Tickler in the novels by repeatedly stabbing him. Meryn Trant is still alive in the novels and remains on Arya's kill list. </li> <li>In the novels, the masks of the <a href="/wiki/Faceless_Men" title="Faceless Men">Faceless Men</a>, made from the preserved faces of corpses, can't simply be slipped on by someone who doesn't have the training to use them. The process involves a blood magic ritual to help the face bond to the wearer as if alive. Then again the TV series moves this around slightly to still say that Arya goes blind from wearing the face, because it is dangerous for untrained people to try to use it. In the book, Arya is given a poisoned drink as punishment, and wakes up blind. </li> <li>Apparently, when Arya returns to the House of Black and White, "Jaqen" was one Faceless Man, and another one was impersonating <a href="/wiki/The_Waif" title="The Waif" class="mw-redirect">The Waif</a>. The Waif is an acolyte, she can't shapeshift - so it isn't clear if in this specific episode, what we see is a Faceless Man <i>imitating</i> the Waif for this one scene (and she's somewhere else in the temple), or if the TV series outright changed this and "the Waif" actually was a Faceless Man throughout the entire season. <ul><li>Given that the Waif returns in Season 6, this was <i>apparently</i> another Faceless Man pretending to be the Waif (at least, she hasn't been shown to also be a shapeshifter like a full-fledged Faceless Man but seems to be a mid-level acolyte). </li></ul> </li> <li>It also isn't clear if the Faceless Man who dies in this episode was even the same man Arya was talking to throughout the season, or a different one imitating him. For that matter, it is possible that Arya could have encountered <i>multiple</i> different Faceless Men throughout the season, each of them using the "Jaqen" persona, and she just <i>assumed</i> they were all the same individual shapeshifter. Alternatively, the "Jaqen" who dies in this episode actually was the man she was talking to throughout the season - but the Faceless Men consider themselves to be "no one" to such an extent that they view themselves as interchangeable. After all, the entire "<a href="/wiki/Jaqen_H%27ghar" title="Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</a> from <a href="/wiki/Lorath" title="Lorath">Lorath</a>" identity was just a false persona that the shapeshifter had adopted. It remains unclear if Arya ever even met that same shapeshifter from Season 2 again after she arrived in Braavos, or if this was just another Faceless Man the entire time. In the novels, it actually was a different Faceless Man, whom she nicknames "The Kindly Man". The writers intentionally left the situation cryptic (as it is supposed to be in the story); when directly asked, <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Cogman" title="Bryan Cogman">Bryan Cogman</a> simply chuckled and pointed out "There is no 'Jaqen H'ghar', there is no 'Kindly Man', he is <i>no one</i>."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[7]</a></sup> </li> <li>In the books, it is strongly implied that another assassination in Westeros (which has not occurred in the TV show) was carried out by the "Jaqen H'ghar" that Arya met at Harrenhal, explaining why he was in Westeros in the first place. This other assassination and Arya's arrival in Braavos happen reasonably close to each other in time, and the distance between Westeros and Braavos is great enough, to imply that "the Kindly Man" and "Jaqen from Harrenhal" can't be the same individual. Thus there was some confusion with the TV writers that they were omitting this other subplot and instead stating that the same individual Faceless Man that Arya met at Harrenhal simply returned to Braavos - though again, Cogman remained coy that there is no one "Jaqen". Instead, it is entirely possible that the "Jaqen from Harrenhal" remained in Westeros and may yet be encountered next season. </li> </ul> </li> <li>In the Season 5 Blu-ray commentary for this episode, Benioff and Weiss admit that the manner in which Arya kills Ser Meryn in a brutal frenzy of violence was loosely influenced by the films of Quentin Tarentino (though they didn't cite a specific film, or if they just meant the same general tonal style).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[8]</a></sup> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Maisie_Williams" title="Maisie Williams">Maisie Williams</a> (Arya Stark) explained how difficult it was to shoot the scene of her pulling face after face off of the dead Faceless Man: "It was very, very complicated. It was madness, actually, when I think about what we did. I had a body double on set that day [for the last shot, when the final face is her own]. You know the cloak that Jaqen was wearing? They made the hood of the cloak out of wire. It was rigid, so the fabric wouldn't move and fall about. Then each different person would lie into the rigid cloak, and they'd shoot my hand doing the motion of taking off the face. Then I got in, and my double did the hand motion over me. So I met, like, seven different people all for three seconds each.

They did not simply give her eyes the appearance of being blind, but cannot be seen through. Thus when Arya is wildly turning around unable to see her surroundings, Williams genuinely couldn't see anything.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup> Incidentally this fits with Williams's previous efforts to play Arya's physicality as described in the novels: Arya is described as left-handed in the books, so Williams has pervasively played her as left-handed, even though in real life she is right handed (to the point that she performs all of her swordfighting or archery moves left-handed). Book-Arya is now blind, and correspondingly, Williams's special contact lenses make her <i>functionally</i> blind, just like Arya. </li> <li>In the March 20, 2015 issue of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, reporters on a set visit noticed a debate happening among the production team on set regarding a nude male extra (apparently the man who flashes Cersei). The extra was clearly circumcised, but no major religion in Westeros practices circumcision (or apparently even in Essos), so they weren't sure if they should retain the actor - however they ultimately decided the shot was so brief that no one would notice. </li> <li>When <a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> encounters a <a href="/wiki/Dothraki" title="Dothraki">Dothraki</a> <a href="/wiki/Khalasar" title="Khalasar"><i>khalasar</i></a> at the end, the novels specify (as Daenerys recalls, which would be difficult to fit into dialogue) that it belongs to Khal <a href="/wiki/Jhaqo" title="Jhaqo">Jhaqo</a> - one of <a href="/wiki/Drogo" title="Drogo">Drogo</a>'s former lieutenants who betrayed her after Drogo died, when his large <i>khalasar</i> broke up and two of his <i>kos</i> (lieutenants) - Jhaqo and <a href="/wiki/Pono" title="Pono">Pono</a> - led away different fractions of it. It was Jhaqo who, in early Season 2, sent back a scouting horse with <a href="/wiki/Rakharo" title="Rakharo">Rakharo</a>'s severed head. In the novels Jhaqo takes part in the rape of a Lhazarene girl Daenerys had taken under her protection, for which Daenerys swears revenge. </li> <li>Daenerys is wearing the same dress that she wore at the gladiator pit, it is just very dirty and tarnished after her ride and time in the wilderness. She also tore some pieces off which were restricting her movement, i.e. pieces from the front which she wrapped around her hands so she could grip onto the dragon better. Her riding leggings did not just randomly appear as a continuity error - the costumers have actually stated that Daenerys <i>always</i> wears Dothraki riding leggings, even after she switched to longer gowns in Season 5, because in the back of her mind, throughout her life she has always had to be prepared to run for her life at a moment's notice. Her leggings can actually seen clearly in "<a href="/wiki/Kill_the_Boy" title="Kill the Boy">Kill the Boy</a>", when Dany visits Hizdahr in his cell.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[11]</a></sup><ul><li> <a href="/wiki/Emilia_Clarke" title="Emilia Clarke">Emilia Clarke</a> has pointed out that there is one thing that remains constant despite all of Daenerys's costume changes over the course of the TV series: she always wears one ring, which she explained is supposed to have belonged to her mother (who died in childbirth). Closer inspection reveals that the ring she drops in this episode is <i>not</i> her mother's ring, it didn't have large white pearls in it - though she has been seen wearing multiple rings at the same time before. Her mother's ring may still be on one of her other fingers, hidden by the straps of cloth she wrapped around her hands. The Inside-the-Episode guide said that with a split-second to think, she dropped it in the vain hope that anyone searching the tracks of the Dothraki riders would find it and know she was there. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> speaks <a href="/wiki/High_Valyrian" title="High Valyrian">High Valyrian</a> for the first time in this episode. Back in episode 3 of Season 5, "<a href="/wiki/High_Sparrow_(episode)" title="High Sparrow (episode)">High Sparrow</a>", it was subtly revealed that he knows High Valyrian: when a Red Priestess is preaching to a crowd in <a href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a>, he clearly understands what she is saying and even makes sarcastic commentary about specific things she says. High Valyrian in their world is loosely similar to how Latin was used in the real-life Middle Ages: the language of a once great and vast but now fallen empire (the <a href="/wiki/Valyrian_Freehold" title="Valyrian Freehold">Valyrian Freehold</a>, loosely inspired by the Roman Republic), which is still used as the prestige language of educated men across much of the world. Even in Westeros, where the Valyrians never spread before the Doom destroyed them, High Valyrian is an esteemed lore-language taught to well-educated lords by the maesters. <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a> knows it reasonably well (he humbly says he's not great at it), while Arya had a few lessons in it but not remotely enough to know more than a few words. Tyrion is a very well-educated son of a major lord, so he knows High Valyrian quite well (though the odd mistake is bound to happen). Logically, he'd probably have looked up what the word for "<a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarf</a>" was at some point given that he is one. <ul> <li>Linguist <a href="/wiki/David_J._Peterson" title="David J. Peterson">David J. Peterson</a> explained some background context of the scene in his blog: <a href="/wiki/Missandei" title="Missandei">Missandei</a> is a master-linguist and she actually knows full well that the High Valyrian word for "dwarf" is "<i>krubo</i>", but she is hesitant to offend Tyrion - because if you think about it, some terms such as "imp" could technically be translated as "dwarf" in another language but can still be offensive, and vice versa - and some people in real life argue that "dwarf" is itself an offensive term, etc. Missandei doesn't want to sound ableist, and fears that calling Tyrion "<i>krubo</i>" might be the High Valyrian equivalent of calling him "imp" (though she was not yet aware that he understands High Valyrian, she still thought it rude to call him that in his presence). Therefore she tries to be polite by just descriptively calling him "<i>byka vala</i>", literally "little man" - but Tyrion then just bluntly says he's called a "<i>krubo</i>", "dwarf".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[12]</a></sup> </li> <li>In fact, the <a href="/wiki/Brothel_guard" title="Brothel guard">Brothel guard</a> in <a href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a> called Tyrion a "<i>krubo</i>" to his face back in the third episode of this season, "<a href="/wiki/High_Sparrow_(episode)" title="High Sparrow (episode)">High Sparrow</a>", and the on-screen subtitles translated it as "dwarf". At the time Tyrion reacted as if he fully understood what the brothel guard said. </li> <li>The full line that Tyrion says is "<i>Krubo. Nyke pāsan kesor udir drējor issa? Munna, nya Valyrio mirrī pungilla issa.</i>" The on-screen subtitles translate this as "Dwarf. I believe that's the word? Apologies, my Valyrian is a bit nostril." Peterson explained that while what he said is intelligible for a non-native speaker of the language, it is somewhat ungrammatical, like trying to speak Latin, and literally what Tyrion says is closer to: "Dwarf. I do believe that is the correct word? Sorrows, my Valyrian is a little nostril." The word for "nostril" is "<i>pungilla</i>", but Missandei corrects him that the word for "rusty" (at a language/skill) is "<i>puñila</i>" - Tyrion mistakenly used the "ng" diphthong, instead of the very similar tilded "ñ".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[13]</a></sup> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella Baratheon</a> hasn't died yet in the novels. When last seen she is heading back to King's Landing with Nymeria Sand, by land - and Jaime isn't even there. On the other hand, at the end of the most recent novel some of the Sand Snakes are sent to King's Landing in various roles - among them the master-poisoner <a href="/wiki/Tyene_Sand" title="Tyene Sand">Tyene Sand</a>, told to infiltrate the Great Sept of Baelor pretending to be a <a href="/wiki/Septa" title="Septa">septa</a> - her mother was a septa in the novels, not Ellaria, and she cultivates a pious persona to appear pure and non-threatening. There is also the prophecy given by <a href="/wiki/Maggy" title="Maggy">Maggy</a> the <a href="/wiki/Woods_witch" title="Woods witch">woods witch</a> - seen at the beginning of Season 5 - stating that all three of Cersei's children would predecease her - or specifically, that all three would have "golden crowns" but also "golden (burial) shrouds". Joffrey and Tommen both literally wore crowns, and in the novels there is a rival plot in Dorne to "crown" Myrcella as the new queen to overthrow Tommen, which comes to nothing, but it wasn't clear if "golden crowns" just figuratively meant their hair color. <ul> <li>That being said, <a href="/wiki/Ellaria_Sand" title="Ellaria Sand">Ellaria Sand</a> never tried to kill Myrcella in the novels - <i>nor</i> did her counterpart succeed in doing it. Ellaria in the novels is one of the characters calling for peace, tired of the cycle of revenge - due to limited screentime and drastic condensations of the Dorne storyline, Ellaria's actions are replaced with those of other characters. </li> <li>The poison used on Myrcella would seem to be "The <a href="/wiki/Long_Farewell" title="Long Farewell">Long Farewell</a>", the same poison Tyene used earlier on <a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> but gave him the antidote which she keeps in her necklace. Ellaria has actually been wearing the same kind of necklace the whole season, a hint that she always had an antidote too. </li> <li>The poison-covered handkerchief that Ellaria throws away after the ship leaves is actually CGI, because the real one just kept dropping straight into the water instead of fluttering away attractively.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[14]</a></sup> </li> <li>The manner in which Myrcella dies rises a few questions for the future: why did Ellaria poison Myrcella after sending her betrothed <a href="/wiki/Trystane_Martell" title="Trystane Martell">Trystane Martell</a> along with her on a ship with Jaime and Bronn, who could take the prince hostage or kill him after Myrcella's assassination? It remains to be seen if Jaime and Bronn will head back to Dorne to demand retribution from Prince Doran, as the ship is fairly close to the harbor, or if they will keep going to King's Landing. <ul><li>In a subsequent interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Benioff and Weiss revealed that when she finds out, Cersei is going to blame <i>Tyrion</i> most of all, because it was his idea to send Myrcella to Dorne in the first place - even though her father Tywin later confirmed the marriage-alliance because he thought it was a good idea, too. This does match a point from Cersei in the most recent novels, in which she starts becoming irrationally paranoid after the deaths of Joffrey and Tywin - both of which she blames on Tyrion, only the latter accurately - and becomes convinced that <i>everything</i> that doesn't go her way must be a plot of either Tyrion or the Tyrells, or even probably Tyrion working <i>with</i> the Tyrells. Tyrion does intend to kill Cersei after fleeing to the Free Cities, but he has no current means of undermining her rule. The Tyrells are actively trying to undermine Cersei and consolidate their own power, but she also blames them for things that they logically could not have done. So it is in keeping with the novels that she would focus her blame for this on Tyrion moreso than on the Martells themselves. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) was also spoken with in the same interview, and he implied that he thought Trystane would indeed end up as a hostage in King's Landing - though offering no explanation as to why Ellaria would endanger Doran's son this way.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[15]</a></sup> </li></ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Myrcella hasn't been shown to know that Jaime is really her father in the novels. On the other hand, she is described as being by far the smartest of Cersei's children - just as out of Tywin's three children, it was Tyrion who inherited the famous Lannister intellect, so too among Cersei's children, it was Myrcella who inherited the family intellect. Tyrion has also complained to Cersei in the novels that it was obvious to anyone who spent a long time living in the Red Keep, and was willing to consider the shocking possibility, that none of Cersei's children were Robert's. Tyrion bluntly asks her if she thinks he is as blind as their father is - Tywin was smart enough to see the clues if he <i>wanted to</i>, but the possibility that his legacy was ruined in such a way was so shocking that he was in denial. Thus it is entirely possible that Myrcella simply put the pieces together over the years - particularly after Stannis started publicly circulating the accusation that Robert wasn't her father, citing that none of Cersei's children even looked like him. </li> <li>Of the six characters with speaking roles who died in this episode, only one - Jon Snow - has actually occurred in the books yet. Stannis and Selyse - and Shireen - have not died in the novels but this subplot was moved up and heavily condensed. Meryn Trant hasn't died, though Arya does kill a different Lannister lackey on her death list, Raff. Myrcella has not died yet in the novels, though this might be moved up from the next novel. <a href="/wiki/Myranda" title="Myranda">Myranda</a> doesn't appear in the novels at all - though she is <i>loosely</i> a gender-swapped condensation of "the Bastard's Boys", a group of Ramsay's lackeys from House Bolton, and some of them do get killed at Winterfell, just not by Theon. </li> <li>Stannis's death renders all branches of <a href="/wiki/House_Baratheon" title="House Baratheon">House Baratheon</a> extinct <i>de facto</i> - though <i>de jure</i>, the Lannisters still claim that <a href="/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon" title="Tommen Baratheon">Tommen</a> is Robert's son. Myrcella's death makes Tommen the last living member of "<a href="/wiki/House_Baratheon_of_King%27s_Landing" title="House Baratheon of King's Landing">House Baratheon of King's Landing</a>". Stannis's death completely renders his <a href="/wiki/Cadet_branch" title="Cadet branch">cadet branch</a> of the family extinct, <a href="/wiki/House_Baratheon_of_Dragonstone" title="House Baratheon of Dragonstone">House Baratheon of Dragonstone</a>. <a href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a>, and any other <a href="/wiki/Bastardy" title="Bastardy">bastards</a> of Robert's that might have survived, are the only direct-line descendants of the House, and no significant cadet branches or cousins of the House have been mentioned. The novels only confirmed that Robert had three surviving bastard children after the purge following Robert's death - but in the TV series, Gendry might be Robert's <i>only</i> surviving child. </li> <li>One of Stannis's officers says that half the men deserted in the night, all the sellswords, and they took all the horses. Previously, Stannis told the Iron Bank in Season 4 that he had about 4,000 men left, perhaps including the baggage train, as when he attacks at Castle Black a visual count shows that he had around 3,000 men. Previously in Season 5, Roose Bolton said that his scouts reported Stannis's army, swelled by foreign sellswords, numbered about 6,000 men - meaning that half of his army were sellswords. During the ensuing <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Winterfell" title="Battle of Winterfell">Battle of Winterfell</a>, visual analysis actually reveals that Stannis has around 1,300 men left. The Bolton army actually numbers a little over 2,000 - it seems larger because they are mounted and Stannis's men are on foot, though cavalry are worth more than infantry. Stannis's men were also exhausted from their grueling march through the snow, while the Bolton forces were fresh - you can even see that many men in the rear of Stannis's army break and flee, though Stannis in the front holds firm. Going by these figures, it would seem that what Stannis's officer meant that "Many men deserted before dawn, nearly half", <i>as well as </i>"all the sellswords, with all the horses" — it wasn't just the "sellsword half" of Stannis's army that fled, 3,000 men, but also half of his <i>Baratheon army</i>, around 1,500 men. </li> <li>Curiously, during the scene where Theon kills Myranda and he and Sansa escape Winterfell, Sansa's gloves disappear in several shots only for them to appear again seconds later, despite it being a fast paced scene with no intervals whatsoever. </li> <li> The scene in which Jon Snow is repeatedly stabbed by his black brothers, with Olly delivering the final blow, resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Assassination of Julius Caesar">Assassination of Julius Caesar</a>, in which he was repeatedly stabbed by senators, including his former friend Brutus. In many fictionalized accounts — including HBO's own <i>Rome</i> series, in which <a href="/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_Hinds" title="Ciarán Hinds">Ciarán Hinds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tobias_Menzies" title="Tobias Menzies">Tobias Menzies</a> portrayed Caesar and Brutus respectively — Brutus tearfully dealt the final blow, to Caesar's surprise, not unlike Olly stabbing Jon. </li> <li>The blood leaking out from under Jon in the final shot isn't produced with CGI, but from a practical effect blood bag underneath the actor. CGI was used, however, to make Jon's eyes dilate at the exact moment he loses consciousness.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[16]</a></sup> </li> <li>The "deaths" of Jon Snow, Stannis Baratheon, and Myrcella Baratheon were filmed somewhat ambiguously, compared to actually seeing their corpses - Jon is badly injured and dying, Myrcella falls poisoned, and Brienne swings her sword but we don't see it actually connect with Stannis. The attack on Jon plays out much the same way in the novels: he is stabbed multiple times, falls to the ground and at least loses consciousness, but then the chapter ends on a cliffhanger. The HBO Viewer's Guide lists all three as "deceased". <b>To avoid endless revert wars on the wiki, these three characters will be treated as dead unless proven otherwise by a subsequent episode.</b> In Stannis's case, Nutter stated that he believed the reason Benioff and Weiss deliberately avoided showing it to prevent making his death scene gratuitous or longer than it needed to be.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[17]</a></sup> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a> is heading to <a href="/wiki/Oldtown" title="Oldtown">Oldtown</a> in the Reach to become a maester. In the novels this occurred soon after Stannis arrived at Castle Black, in part because Jon feared Melisandre would want to burn Aemon due to his royal Targaryen blood (he was in fact the son of a king who actually sat on the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a>). Therefore it was widely believed that this storyline would be omitted from the TV series, but in fact it was only delayed. Coupled with several other casting announcements, it appears that Season 6 actually will cover several subplots that were skipped from the most recent novel (see below). However, most of Season 6 will still be based on a single book, which probably means it won't be as heavily condensed as Season 5 was. </li> <li>"Mother's Mercy" won several Emmy Awards for 2015:<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[18]</a></sup><ul> <li>Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series – <a href="/wiki/David_Nutter" title="David Nutter">David Nutter</a> </li> <li>Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series – <a href="/wiki/David_Benioff" title="David Benioff">David Benioff</a> and <a href="/wiki/D.B._Weiss" title="D.B.

Martin has stated that <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a>'s naked <a href="/wiki/Walk_of_atonement" title="Walk of atonement">walk of atonement</a> is loosely based on what happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Shore" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Jane Shore">Jane Shore</a>, the mistress of King Edward IV of England (who, like Robert Baratheon, was a great warrior who won the crown on the battlefield in his youth, but became fat and ill-suited to rule in later life). After Edward IV died his brother Richard III usurped the throne ahead of his nephews. He deeply resented Jane, so he had her arrested and made her perform a penance walk, a common punishment for harlotry. Jane Shore did not perform the penance walk naked, however, but had to walk barefoot through the streets of London wearing only her kirtle (petticoat), which given the times was still said to have gained significant male attention (the main source of the humiliation was that this was a punishment normally meted out to harlots). Martin has said that the Wars of the Roses were one of the major inspirations for his novels: the conflict was between the Yorks and Lancasters, while in Westeros the conflict is between the Starks and Lannisters (clearly named after the real families).<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[20]</a></sup> </li> <li> <b>The production team carefully made sure never to have any nude scenes with Cersei since the beginning of the TV series, specifically to prepare for this scene.</b> Cersei always wears heavy layers of clothing like armor, and even in her sex scenes, it was a conscious choice never to show her with her clothes off. For example, when <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a> encounters Cersei and Jaime having sex at Winterfell, they are both actually naked in the novels, but not in the TV version - though of course, Headey was also pregnant in Season 1 so they had to use body doubles or different camera angles (still wearing heavy clothes while in a doggy-style position) to hide her pregnancy. Even later when she has sex with Lancel, or when she has sex with Jaime in the Season 4 finale (in the privacy of the <a href="/wiki/White_Sword_Tower" title="White Sword Tower">White Sword Tower</a>), she never takes her clothes off during sex scenes. All of this was decided <i>years in advance</i>, to increase the dramatic impact of Cersei's shocking disempowerment, stripped naked and marched through the streets. As Headey said: </li> </ul> <dl><dd><dl><dd>"We talk about it a lot because I love he...I think, you know, it’s interesting, that part for me. I’ve been very adamant about keeping her kind of clothed because I think that’s part of her power. And she can still be sort of sexual and weird and female, but she doesn’t have to be naked. And I think it makes for a more shocking disempowering moment when this happens. So, we’ll see. I’m a little scared.”<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[21]</a></sup> </dd></dl></dd></dl> <ul> <li>In the novels, when Cersei is shorn, the septas remove <i>all</i> of her body hair - her eyebrows, pubic hair, even scraping the rest of her body. They shave her head completely bald. In the TV episode, the septas prominently produce a razor blade as if they are going to shave her, but then curiously do not use it at all. One septa separately picks up a pair of shears, and cuts her luxurious long golden hair off - but crops it close to her head, instead of shaving her bald entirely. In her subsequent nude scenes the rest of her body hair isn't shaved. </li> <li>The TV episode didn't quite explain this, but Cersei does bring up <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> to the <a href="/wiki/High_Sparrow" title="High Sparrow">High Sparrow</a>. The Sparrows do realize that if they outright depose Cersei and the Lannisters, it would clear the way for Stannis to take the throne - whom they view as a heretic for embracing the <a href="/wiki/R%27hllor" title="R'hllor">Lord of Light</a> religion. Therefore they don't want to get rid of the Lannisters entirely, but they want to strip them of power and control them. Had he wanted to simply depose Cersei he would have left her in her prison cell: he let her go in a humiliating walk of atonement so the mobs of the city's commoners wouldn't fear her anymore. </li> <li>As the TV producers point out in the Inside the Episode featurette, Cersei has badly mistreated the <a href="/wiki/Smallfolk" title="Smallfolk">Smallfolk</a> of King's Landing, either directly through starting the war or indirectly through not controlling Joffrey's madness as he mistreated them. She is a woman who could have someone's tongue cut out for insulting her. The novels include more scenes around the <a href="/wiki/Riot_of_King%27s_Landing" title="Riot of King's Landing">Riot of King's Landing</a> in which peasant women hold up their dead babies and point at Cersei, accusing that their children are dying of starvation from a war she started - Cersei doesn't really care. Recall that back at the beginning of Season 2, before the riot, the Small Council tried to warn her that refugees are pouring into the city from the countryside and it is overburdening the food supply - Cersei bluntly doesn't care, and agrees with Littlefinger that when winter comes and the poorest starve they'll simply have less commoners to deal with. </li> <li>The TV series also doesn't bring up the history that a walk of atonement has in <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" title="House Lannister">House Lannister</a>. Tywin's father <a href="/wiki/Tytos_Lannister" title="Tytos Lannister">Tytos Lannister</a> was a weak-willed man whose inept leadership nearly destroyed their rule. After Tywin's mother died, Tytos took up with a new mistress, a commoner a step above a whore herself, who in time came to control Tytos to such an extent that she was said to be the real master of <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a>. The teenaged Tywin later violently reasserted Lannister dominance in the <a href="/wiki/Reyne_Rebellion" title="Reyne Rebellion">Reyne Rebellion</a>, the first major step in almost single-handedly rebuilding the Lannisters into a strong House again after Tytos nearly ended it - Tytos didn't even respond to the rebellion at all, simply staying in Casterly Rock with his mistress, and Tywin reacted without his permission. After Cersei's grandfather finally died of old age and Tywin succeeded him as lord, he forced Tytos's mistress to make a naked walk of atonement through the streets - humiliating her and symbolically stripping her of any of the power she was once perceived to have. Cersei's uncle <a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan</a> aided Tywin at the time and thinks back on this in his inner POV monologue (in a way not easily translatable on-screen). Tywin's bad treatment of his own children came back around to destroy his family - apart from Tyrion personally killing him, the Lannisters have come full circle. Just as Tywin's power began with forcing Tytos's mistress to make a naked walk of atonement, that power has now fallen with Cersei making a walk of atonement. </li> <li>Actress <a href="/wiki/Lena_Headey" title="Lena Headey">Lena Headey</a> (Cersei) wears a wig to portray Cersei, instead of her own (dyed) hair. The wigs in the TV series are made of real human hair, and can cost as much as $7,000. Cersei's wig does not undergo any chemical processing at all (which is used on some of the other wigs to make them the exact color they need to be). Rather, the wig maker sourced individual colors and strands of hair, which were then individually knotted onto a lace cap one strand at a time to achieve the perfect golden blonde blend.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[22]</a></sup> While it is unconfirmed if the Cersei wig cost $7,000 dollars, it is certainly one of the more expensive and elaborate wigs used in the TV series, easily costing several thousand dollars. It isn't clear if the actual Cersei wig was destroyed in the scene where Cersei is shorn, or if it was a stand-in wig. <ul><li>In interviews following this episode, Lena Headey herself expressed just how much putting on the Cersei wig helped her easily step into character: "If I put the wig on, that's massive. That's an immediate feeling. It's really important. What was slightly daunting was what was going to be taken away. It can change how you feel, but it can't change how she is." Headey also said that she still wears a different wig after Cersei's hair is shorn, instead of dyeing her own hair, "a really heavily, heavily cropped cut-up wig."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[23]</a></sup> In a separate interview, Headey remarked about Cersei's punishment that they "shave her hair off like Aslan"<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[24]</a></sup> - comparing Cersei to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslan" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Aslan">Aslan</a> the lion from <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i>, Narnia's fantasy analogue of Jesus Christ who, in an analogue of the Crucifixion, is ceremonially shorn of his mane of hair and then executed by the evil White Witch. House Lannister's symbol is, of course, a golden lion. </li></ul> </li> <li>Lena Headey (Cersei) isn't actually naked in the walk of atonement scene: actress <a href="/wiki/Rebecca_Van_Cleave" title="Rebecca Van Cleave">Rebecca Van Cleave</a> served as a nude body double, and Headey's head was then digitally added onto van Cleave's body (her neck doesn't quite match in some shots if you look carefully, and the body isn't exactly her height and shoulder width). The producers did try very hard to find a double whose body frame matched Headey's: 1,000 actresses applied to be the double, and of these seven finalists were flown to Belfast so the producers could choose the one that most closely matched. Headey was asked if she wanted to help pick out the body double but she declined, saying, "I was like, 'Listen guys, she happens to have a beautiful body, but I don't do casting. If somebody is brave enough to do this, I applaud it." Headey was present with Van Cleave during actual shooting: she would walk her double through each shot, giving step-by-step insight into Cersei's mindset. Van Cleave was fully nude, Headey wore a simple beige shift. They would then alternate between shots, with Headey stepping in for those closeups that didn't involve full nudity (thus Headey actually did "perform" the barefoot walk through the streets, though the camera wasn't always on her). Because Headey was present during all of the jeering by the crowd of extras, she said it helped give a genuine emotional reaction when she appeared on-screen for closeup shots. Van Cleave said: "Lena was so good about walking beside me and guiding me into what Cersei was thinking and the movements. We were playing tag team — 'You’re it!' — and trying to make light of the fact we’re all covered in everything and going through this together." The large crowds used in the scene contained 500 extras. The entire sequence took three consecutive days to film.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[26]</a></sup> There were initially some objections about doing the nude walk in Dubrovnik's streets, made by the Church of St. Nicholas which is located about 60 meters north of where the walk ends. They later withdrew their objections on the condition that it not actually cross into holy ground.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[27]</a></sup><ul> <li>Why a body double was used was unclear at the time - given that Headey has done nude scenes before (such as in the film <i>300</i>), and back in March 2014, she even spoke about the upcoming scene in such a way that it seemed she was interested in performing it herself.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[29]</a></sup> Headey only said that she chose not to perform the nude scene "for several reasons".<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[30]</a></sup> One possible but unconfirmed explanation was that in February 2015 (after filming had ended), Headey revealed that she was pregnant with her second child - but she was so upset about how the media had been invasive about the divorce of her first marriage that she would not reveal who the father was, or any other details about her personal life. Months later, Lena Headey announced via Twitter that she gave birth to her daughter on July 10, 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[31]</a></sup> The scene, however, was filmed in the first week of October, 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[32]</a></sup> Subtracting nine months of pregnancy from July 10, 2015, Headey probably only conceived her second child around mid-October, maybe early October at the earliest - so Headey probably <i>was not</i> pregnant when this scene was filmed, but conceived the week after it (assuming this wasn't an overly long pregnancy). Moreover, filming of the scene was also delayed for some time due to complaints about filming it in public, and it took time to hire a body double: it is implausible that Heady discovered she had <i>just</i> become pregnant on October 2nd and then quickly hired a body double, the selection process that Rebecca Van Cleave went through took longer than that. Headey's ultimate reason for wanting to use a body double remains private. </li> <li>Headey mentioned in the March 20, 2015 issue of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that her body double is actually wearing a pubic wig to cover her genitals - the TV show has done this several times before, i.e. with Melisandre. In the same issue Headey was again vague and only said "I obviously chose not to be naked for several reasons." </li> <li>In the Blu-ray commentary for this episode, it was vaguely mentioned that Headey was worried that she would be too focused on her own nudity, to the point that she wouldn't really be "acting" with Cersei's mindset anymore, and this would affect her emotional responses in the performance. </li> <li>The matter was finally put to rest in an interview Lena Headey gave with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> in April 2016, just prior to the Season 6 premiere. Headey confirmed that she chose to use a body double simply because when production came up to this point, she felt she would be so distracted by being naked that she would not be able to give the same emotional response that Cersei-the-character is supposed to have in the scene. She also cited that she has done nude scenes before and the simple fact that it was a nude scene had nothing to do with her choice. As she explained, the script calls for Cersei to be absolutely stoic and unemotional during the whole ordeal, only starting to cry just as it ends and she enters the castle. Headey didn't think she could keep her face this unemotional if she was actually naked in front of a large crowd - not that she would break down crying, but rather, Headey felt she couldn't restrain her <i>anger</i>, that she would end up scowling or glaring, when the script specifically says that Cersei is absolutely expressionless. In Headey's own words: </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"Some people thought I was less of an actress because I didn’t get my tits out. It was really a bit shocking. I've done nudity. I'm not averse to it. But I know I'm a very emotional actor and I get really driven by that. In order to do my job, I allow myself to be really vulnerable. I don't know any other way to do my job. Things really affect me. And the thought of being naked for three days and trying to contain her in the way she would be I think I would feel very angry. I didn't want to be angry. I don't think Cersei would be angry. I did what I thought she would do, emotionally. And wonderful Rebecca [Van Cleave, Headey’s stand-in] was able to contain herself and be naked. She found it very difficult, obviously. It's not a natural thing to do. I film every year and I have kids and they know me now and [being naked in the scene] was just too much on top of that. So yeah, people that get it thought it was great. I didn't phone it in; I was actually there for three days with Rebecca."<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[33]</a></sup> </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl> <ul><li>Several professional reviews criticized the logistics of the scene - not Headey's choice to use a body double in the first place (which Benioff and Weiss had no control over), but that the CGI used to match Headey's head to the double's naked body was too noticeable (though given that it was Headey's choice, there was only so much the production team could do to work around it). Also, <i>Express</i> criticized that a major point from the novels was lost by casting a 27 year old body double, given that both Cersei the character and Lena Headey are over 40 years old. In the novels, the naked walk is even more humiliating, because while Cersei was famously beautiful as a teenager, two decades of time and three pregnancies have taken their toll, and her aging body actually isn't very attractive anymore. Cersei used to wield her beauty like a weapon to intimidate others, but when the crowd sees her specific signs of aging, she loses a large part of her mystique, causing them to no longer fear her, and then openly mock her.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[34]</a></sup> It is possible that there simply weren't many actresses over the age of 30 who were willing to be a nude body double that also closely matched Headey's general body proportions, in which case the production team was simply faced with picking from what was available. </li></ul> <h3 id="The_Stannis_storyline_in_the_North" section="18">The Stannis storyline in the North</h3> <p>Previous seasons of the TV series adapted roughly one novel into one TV season (and the third novel is so long that it was split into two halves, as Season 3 and Season 4). For unclear reasons, the TV producers tried to adapt most major storylines from <i>both</i> the fourth and fifth novels into a single TV season, resulting in many subplots being significantly condensed. Subplots revolving around <a href="/wiki/The_North" title="The North">the North</a> in particular were drastically condensed. <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a> remained in <a href="/wiki/The_Vale_of_Arryn" title="The Vale of Arryn">the Vale of Arryn</a> in the novels, and never even met the Boltons. <a href="/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a> remained fruitlessly searching for the Stark girls in <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">The Riverlands</a>, witnessing firsthand the massive devastation the war has inflicted. </p> <p>Stannis leaves the Wall about a third of the way into the fifth novel, what would be about two thirds in a normally structured novel (as the fifth one follows only half the characters, it contains what would be two novels' worth of storyline for each subplot). In the TV series, Stannis left the Wall at the halfway point of the season (the end of episode 5), and most of the major story points from his time at the Wall in the book were covered. </p> <p>However, most of Stannis's narrative in the fifth novel follows that point, when he is on his campaign advancing south — though at first we only read it by hearsay, and then only by witnesses who are not close to Stannis, as Stannis himself is not a point of view character and Davos is not present. At any rate, this is where Stannis's storyline was heavily condensed — sending <a href="/wiki/Davos_Seaworth" title="Davos Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a> to <a href="/wiki/White_Harbor" title="White Harbor">White Harbor</a> to treat with the wealthy <a href="/wiki/House_Manderly" title="House Manderly">House Manderly</a>; slowly rallying several Northern mountain clans to his side based on advice given to him by Jon Snow; defeating the <a href="/wiki/Ironborn" title="Ironborn">ironborn</a> at Deepwood Motte; winning <a href="/wiki/House_Mormont" title="House Mormont">House Mormont</a> and <a href="/wiki/House_Glover" title="House Glover">House Glover</a> to his side and more than tripling the size of his original forces; Arnolf Karstark's treason; and preparing for the incoming battle in the snow against the Freys and Manderlys in a crofters' village. On top of this, much of the last two episodes of Stannis's storyline isn't even from the fifth novel - the TV producers jumped ahead, to condense in additional material from the unpublished sixth novel, such as the burning of Shireen and Stannis's fight against the Boltons and eventual defeat. </p> <p>In the novels, therefore, Stannis's march against Winterfell is quite different. Rather than losing men, he has gained thousands of new Northern allies, and their advance is a serious threat to the Boltons. The odds are still against them, but even Roose Bolton is deeply concerned that Stannis's assault might so badly weaken his armies that the rest of the North will rise up in revolt to overthrow the Boltons. The fifth novel ends on a cliffhanger, as the battle occurred off-screen and the outcome is unknown. The Boltons seem to have at least taken significant loses, but Jon Snow receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton claiming that he has killed Stannis and demanding that he hand over Stannis's wife and daughter (who remained at Castle Black). </p> <p>In contrast, in the TV version's heavily condensed version of events, which used up not only all of the fifth novel's material but also some of the sixth novel's (all in a single TV season), Stannis's march against Winterfell comes to an abrupt end after many of his men flee before and during the battle, in which his remaining forces are promptly defeated off-screen. </p> <p>In the novels, the Battle of Winterfell was the major battle serving as the climax of the fifth book. In the TV series, the <a href="/wiki/Massacre_at_Hardhome" title="Massacre at Hardhome">Massacre at Hardhome</a> (from episode 8 "<a href="/wiki/Hardhome_(episode)" title="Hardhome (episode)">Hardhome</a>") was instead treated as the major battle sequence climax of Season 5, though it only appeared off-screen in the novels because Jon Snow did not personally go there. Line producer Snorri Þórisson confirmed in July 2014 that the Hardhome sequence was significantly expanded in rewrites which occurred late in the production schedule of Season 5. The original plan was to film at least something of events at Hardhome in Iceland in November 2014 (because Iceland was used for scenes <a href="/wiki/Beyond_the_Wall" title="Beyond the Wall">Beyond the Wall</a> before). However, the window for filming in Iceland's winter months is very narrow - when the Hardhome battle sequence was expanded to the point that it took a full 15 days to film, production had to be moved back to Northern Ireland. Thus it is unclear if the <i>original</i> plan for Season 5 was to treat the Battle of Winterfell as a major on-screen battle sequence, but later rewrites shifted focus and resources to the battle at Hardhome.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[35]</a></sup></p> <p>For further discussion of the reasoning behind adapting two novels into Season 5, instead of the one book (or less) per season format used for all previous TV seasons, see the pertinent "<a href="/wiki/Season_5#Adaptation" title="Season 5">Season 5 - Adaptation</a>" section. </p> <h3 id="Jon_Snow.27s_fate" section="19">Jon Snow's fate</h3> <p>The Stannis/Bolton storyline also intersects with the Night's Watch storyline, and these condensations affect it in the finale as well: in response to Ramsay's threatening letter, Jon says he will break his vow of neutrality to kill Ramsay, and <i>this</i> is the point which makes several of his own officers stab him repeatedly in the courtyard, saying "for the Watch". They only turn on Jon after he makes a very grey moral decision, and neither side is presented as <i>entirely</i> correct: if Jon strictly keeps to his vows the Boltons will destroy the North and the Watch, yet attacking the Boltons is breaking one of the Watch's most central vows and if they fail, it might invoke the wrath of the Lannisters against the Watch. The TV version in contrast presents Jon's attackers as simply motivated by an unwillingness to let go of their old grudge against the wildlings. </p> <p>The TV version gave no clear reason why the Night's Watch officers choose this specific moment to betray Jon - when if Thorne and the others wanted to betray Jon because he was saving the wildlings, in the immediately preceding episode they could have just refused to let Jon and the wildlings back through the Wall. It is possible that Melisandre's news about Stannis's death and the Bolton's victory influenced their decision, but if so it was not mentioned, in order to increase the shock of their betrayal. Further, Melisandre never abandons Stannis to flee back to Castle Black, but remains at the Wall with his family and some of his soldiers, explaining that it is one of the "hinges of the world" and her magical abilities are much more powerful there. </p> <p>Jon is stabbed in the novels as he is preparing to leave Castle Black to fight the Boltons. He is not stabbed by <a href="/wiki/Olly" title="Olly">Olly</a>, a character invented for the TV show (loosely Olly is a condensation of aspects of several other characters). <a href="/wiki/Alliser_Thorne" title="Alliser Thorne">Alliser Thorne</a> doesn't stab Jon: after he beheaded <a href="/wiki/Janos_Slynt" title="Janos Slynt">Janos Slynt</a>, he sent Thorne away on a scouting mission beyond the Wall. Thorne, who dislikes Jon much more in the novels, outright tells him that after Janos's death he knows Jon will execute him too at the slightest legitimate excuse - but unlike Janos, he isn't stupid enough to give him that excuse, so he accepts Jon's command and quietly leaves. In the novels, the remaining older and high ranking officers at Castle Black grow increasingly frustrated with Jon's resettling of the wildlings south of the Wall, and even repairing several abandoned forts along the Wall and restaffing them with wildling garrisons. The first man to stab Jon is actually First Steward <a href="/wiki/Bowen_Marsh" title="Bowen Marsh">Bowen Marsh</a> - several other men also stab Jon, but the chapter is told from his perspective, and as he is losing consciousness he doesn't take note of who they are. The TV series had <i>all</i> of the high ranking officers stab him: Bowen Marsh, First Builder <a href="/wiki/Othell_Yarwyck" title="Othell Yarwyck">Othell Yarwyck</a>, and Ser Aliser Thorne, who is not made First Ranger in the novels. </p> <p>Oddly, during the first season it was believed that actor <a href="/wiki/Brian_Fortune" title="Brian Fortune">Brian Fortune</a> was playing Bowen Marsh, and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_McKeever" title="Dennis McKeever">Dennis McKeever</a> was playing <a href="/wiki/Othell_Yarwyck" title="Othell Yarwyck">Othell Yarwyck</a>, based on comments made by Fortune, and McKeever's character delivering one of Yarwyck's lines from the books. However, when Fortune reappeared in <a href="/wiki/Season_4" title="Season 4">Season 4</a>, he was expressly identified by name in on-screen dialogue as playing Othell Yarwyck, apparently to confirm that a minor retcon about had taken place about what character he was playing. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Condron" title="Michael Condron">Michael Condron</a> then joined the TV series in <a href="/wiki/Season_5" title="Season 5">Season 5</a>, and was announced to be playing <a href="/wiki/Bowen_Marsh" title="Bowen Marsh">Bowen Marsh</a> - as well as identified as Marsh by name early in the season. Given that Bowen Marsh is the man who betrays Jon Snow, it was suspected that the role was recast because the producers were expanding the role and wanted to focus on him more prominently in Season 5. As it turned out, neither Yarwyck nor Marsh were given significantly more scenes in Season 5, and instead <i>all</i> of the high ranking officers stab Jon, apparently led by Alliser Thorne. </p> <p>Elio Garcia, owner of Westeros.org and co-author with <a href="/wiki/George_R.R._Martin" title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a> of the <i>World of Ice and Fire</i> sourcebook (2014) also expressed his bafflement at this change in his official video review of the Season 5, finale: "<b>Why in the world did Alliser Thorne let them [Jon and the wildlings] through the Wall - if he was planning to kill him?</b> -- The only thing I can think of is that Stannis was still alive at that point, or still fighting, and so he was concerned that if he did anything against Jon, that Stannis would deal with him later, but now they heard Stannis is dead..."<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[36]</a></sup></p> <p>It remains to be seen how the TV show will explain the apparent logical discrepancy: why would Thorne let Jon and the wildlings through the Wall, only to then stab Jon for commanding him to do so - when he could have just refused to let Jon and the wildlings through the Wall in the first place, as the wildlings already through the Wall outnumber the Castle Black garrison a hundred to one. Muddying the question is that it is unclear in the TV version at what point Thorne decided to betray Jon and what the actual tipping point was that made the mutiny happen specifically when it did: if Thorne even intended to betray Jon when he let the wildlings through the Wall, or if Thorne did want to betray Jon then but feared being seen as a traitor in front of all of the other Watch members standing guard atop the Wall if he kept the gate closed, etc. If it is outright stated in Season 6 that Thorne decided to turn on Jon only <i>after</i> the wildlings came through the Wall because, for example, Melisandre brought news of the Boltons' victory, it won't actually be a plot hole within the TV continuity's own internal logic. </p> <p><i>Game of Thrones Wiki</i> keeps getting a lot of questions about <b>"is Jon Snow really dead?"</b> - and the cast and crew are often asked this at convention panels (as if they would randomly reveal this during a public Q&amp;A). </p> <p>The short answer is simply that: </p> <ul> <li>1 - "Is Jon Snow dead"? <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUUJSj3AzKo">Indubitably.</a> Yes, Jon Snow is dead. </li> <li>2 - Death is not necessarily a permanent condition. </li> <li>3 - Nonetheless, death is not without consequence. </li> </ul> <p><a href="/wiki/George_R.R._Martin" title="George R.R.

Martin</a> put it in a post-episode comment to <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that: "If there’s one thing we know in <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> is that death is not necessarily permanent."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[37]</a></sup></p> <p>One of Martin's major criticisms of other Fantasy literature is that the protagonists tend not to die, and if they do die, they can be resurrected none the worse for wear. For example, Gandalf the wizard returns from death in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> but overall he is not too negatively affected. In contrast, when <a href="/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion" title="Beric Dondarrion">Beric Dondarrion</a> is repeatedly raised from the dead soon after fatal injuries, as seen in Season 3, it is presented as a deeply traumatic experience which drastically changed him. </p> <p>The question therefore is not so much "<i>will</i> Jon Snow come back from the dead?", so much as "if he does come back from the dead, <i>who</i> will he be?" </p> <h3 id="Because_much_of_the_fourth_and_fifth_novels_were_adapted_into_Season_5.2C_and_the_fifth_novel_is_the_last_published_one.2C_most_characters_have_caught_up_with_their_material_from_the_books_as_of_this_episode." section="21"> Because much of the fourth and fifth novels were adapted into Season 5, and the fifth novel is the last published one, most characters have caught up with their material from the books as of this episode. </h3> <p>Several characters have completely caught up with the books, while others are basically caught up, though they are a chapter or two away from the end of their published material. <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a> had one more chapter talking with the Last Greenseer in his cave but his arrival was a more convenient stopping point.

Meanwhile, there are other subplots which from the fourth and fifth novels, particularly the Greyjoy, Reach, and Riverlands storylines (as well as drastic condensations to the Dorne storyline), that have been delayed in comparison to the chronology of the books but will appear in Season 6, and certain other storylines which were heavily condensed with others (Sansa's Vale storyline) to the point that they may no longer appear at all. </p> <p><b>Characters and subplots that have caught up with their current material from the novels:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Night%27s_Watch" title="Night's Watch">Night's Watch</a> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Meereen" title="Meereen">Meereen</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> and <a href="/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell" title="Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a> (except for one additional Small Council chapter) </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Petyr_Baelish" title="Petyr Baelish">Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish</a> <ul><li> <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a>'s storyline was merged with <a href="/wiki/Jeyne_Poole" title="Jeyne Poole">Jeyne Poole</a>'s from the fifth novel, who is forced to marry Ramsay; her Vale storylines have now been diverted while she has reached the end of Jeyne Poole's material from the most recent novel. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon" title="Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Melisandre" title="Melisandre">Melisandre</a> <ul><li> <a href="/wiki/Davos_Seaworth" title="Davos Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a> was involved in other subplots in the North which were cut, but with Stannis's defeat now it is unknown if these will be drawn on later. </li></ul> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Roose_Bolton" title="Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton" title="Ramsay Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</a> </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran Stark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hodor" title="Hodor">Hodor</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Meera_Reed" title="Meera Reed">Meera Reed</a> - already caught up at the end of Season 4, except for one chapter. </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy" title="Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</a>, except for his experiences after escaping Winterfell. </li> </ul> <p><b>Characters and subplots that have not yet caught up with the books:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a> - Arya goes blind at the end of the fourth novel, but is still alive.

Arya has two more chapters in the fifth novel which have not yet been adapted. Arya also doesn't kill Raff (Meryn Trant in the TV series) in the fifth novel, but in a chapter from the sixth novel which Martin officially released on his website (it had been completed long ago, and he apparently wanted viewers to know what Arya's climactic scene this season was based on). </li> <li> <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gilly" title="Gilly">Gilly</a> are now heading to <a href="/wiki/Oldtown" title="Oldtown">Oldtown</a> - which is on the southern end of Westeros, opposite from the Wall.

However, this subplot will appear in <a href="/wiki/Season_6" title="Season 6">Season 6</a>. </li> <li>The subplots in <a href="/wiki/The_Riverlands" title="The Riverlands">The Riverlands</a>, centering around the Frey siege of the Tullys at <a href="/wiki/Riverrun" title="Riverrun">Riverrun</a> - which involved <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a> in the novels, and also <a href="/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a>'s wandering in the Riverlands (several characters of which <i>do</i> appear in the casting calls for Season 6, but they may have been moved to subplots of other characters). Given how much Jaime and Brienne's subplots were changed in Season 5, it is unclear how these will play out in Season 6. The Tully garrison at Riverrun is commanded by Catelyn's uncle <a href="/wiki/Brynden_Tully" title="Brynden Tully">Brynden "The Blackfish" Tully</a>: in the novels, Robb left Brynden in charge of defending Riverrun so he was not present for the massacre at the Red Wedding. Instead, he continues to command the besieged Tully garrison at Riverrun, still fighting in the name of King Robb even though at this point the garrison has no realistic hope for long-term survival, much less victory. The TV show had him come to the wedding (apparently as a condensation or to lull suspicions of the impending massacre), but it still has Brynden escape - he happened to step out of the castle to relieve himself just as the massacre started, avoiding the slaughter in the main hall, and thus managed to simply fight his way out of the assault on the camps outside. It is implied that Brynden may have fled back to Riverrun, but ultimately the TV version did not reveal what happened to him. <ul><li>Set reports in Fall 2015 revealed that an entire exterior Riverrun castle set has been constructed, and reports in October 2015 confirmed that Brynden Tully <i>will</i> return, and have a verbal confrontation with Jaime Lannister during the siege of Riverrun as he did in the fourth novel. Bronn will also accompany Jaime as his assistant - again taking the place of <a href="/wiki/Ilyn_Payne" title="Ilyn Payne">Ilyn Payne</a> as he did in Season 4 (due to the actor's recovery from near-terminal pancreatic cancer).<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[38]</a></sup> </li></ul> </li> <li>Much of the <a href="/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a> subplot was <i>extremely</i> condensed, to the point that <a href="/wiki/Doran_Martell" title="Doran Martell">Doran Martell</a> only briefly appeared in Season 5, and many other members of <a href="/wiki/House_Martell" title="House Martell">House Martell</a> didn't appear and were thought to have been adapted out (the TV series did state that there are eight Sand Snakes - there are four adult ones, and the fourth gets involved in other storylines). Nor did it include Doran's daughter and heir Arianne Martell, who has apparently been omitted from the TV continuity entirely. </li> <li>Tyrion's storyline as he was heading east to Meereen introduced a major new subplot involving a major political shakeup in the <a href="/wiki/Free_Cities" title="Free Cities">Free Cities</a>. This was cut completely from Tyrion's storyline in Season 5, but after he leaves for Meereen it subsequently intersects with several other subplots (not Arya's).
