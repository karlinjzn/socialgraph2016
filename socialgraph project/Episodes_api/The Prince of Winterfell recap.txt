Theon enters, and she greets him as the “Prince of Winterfell.” He accuses her of being envious of his prize and says that she should be proud of his achievement; taking Winterfell with just twenty men. Yara sarcastically calls him a great warrior and says that she saw the bodies above the gates. She asks which of the boys was tougher “the cripple or the six-year-old?” The barb brings a laugh from her men. Theon insists that he treated the Stark children with honor and was repaid with treachery. Yara counters that it was dishonorable to butcher them. Theon maintains that he treated them well, until he was forced to kill them. Yara examines the events saying that Theon seizing Winterfell was within his rights as an <a href="/wiki/Ironborn" title="Ironborn">Ironborn</a>, but says that a prisoner fleeing captivity seems brave to her. </p> <p>Theon asserts that the Starks made him a promise, and Yara mocks him for getting mad about the broken promises of little boys. She asks if he is “the dumbest cunt alive.” Theon balks at the name calling but Yara repeats it over and again, chastising him for killing the valuable hostages. Theon insists that he had to kill the children to avoid appearing weak. Yara retorts that he is both weak and stupid. Theon says that he is warning her, and Yara urges him to continue. Theon notices her men watching him and berates her for not bringing enough reinforcements. He wonders how she expects him to hold the castle with so few men. Yara reveals that she is not leaving any of her men and has come to bring Theon home. She says that their father wants to speak to him. Theon is disbelieving and asserts that Winterfell is the heart of the north. Yara counters that it is more than a hundred miles from the sea and reminds Theon that their ships are the source of their power. She warns Theon that his attempt to show strength, by displaying the bodies, has turned every man in the north against him. She begins to warn him of what will happen when King <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> finds out. Theon insists that Robb will not learn of the murders, because they have killed all of the ravens and seized the horses. He asserts that he took Winterfell and that he will keep it. </p> <p>Yara dismisses her men. Once they are gone she softens her tone and reminds Theon of their family bond. She says that they both loved their mother and both endured their father. She implores him to return home with her instead of dying in Winterfell alone. Theon says that he does not intend to die. Yara looks into his eyes and tells him that he was a terrible baby. She recalls that he was always crying and never slept. She remembers a night when he was particularly loud, and she went to see him. When Theon saw her he stopped screaming and smiled at her. She ends the discussion by urging him not to die so far from the sea. </p> <h2 id="Scene_3" section="3">Scene 3</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":2}' data-ref="2"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0d/Rattleshirt.png/revision/latest?cb=20120521123900"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201280%20720'%2F%3E" alt="Rattleshirt.png" width="1280" height="720"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0d/Rattleshirt.png/revision/latest?cb=20120521123900" alt="Rattleshirt.png" width="1280" height="720"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Ygritte delivers Jon to the Lord of Bones</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Ygritte" title="Ygritte">Ygritte</a> leads <a href="/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a> across a glacial lake with the rest of her party.

Ygritte asserts that <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a> will want to question Jon because he knows about the plans of the Watch. The Lord of Bones counters that Qhorin knows more and orders Jon killed. Ygritte defends Jon, citing his honorable treatment of her when she was his prisoner. The Lord of Bones is unmoved and repeats his order. Ygritte reveals Jon’s status as the bastard son of <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a> and insists that Mance will want him. Rattleshirt asks why Mance should care about a dead man’s bastard and Ygritte retorts that Mance will want to decide for himself. The Lord of Bones threatens to castrate Jon if he attempts to escape and Ygritte says that she would do it herself if he tries to escape. She turns to Jon and says that they are even. </p> <p>Ygritte pushes Jon to the ground next to Qhorin. Jon tells the ranger that he was unable to kill Ygritte. Qhorin has already worked out the sequence of events. Jon asks where the other men are and Qhorin tells him that they turned back to look for him when he did not return. He says that the wildlings found them while they were tracking Jon. Jon realizes that the others died because of his actions. Qhorin tells him to make sure that they did not die for nothing. </p> <h2 id="Scene_4" section="4">Scene 4</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":3}' data-ref="3"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0d/Robb_and_Talisa.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720020725"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Robb and Talisa.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0d/Robb_and_Talisa.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720020725" alt="Robb and Talisa.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Robb and Talisa take a walk</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> and <a href="/wiki/Talisa_Maegyr" title="Talisa Maegyr" class="mw-redirect">Talisa Maegyr</a> walk through woodland near a riverbank on their way back from <a href="/wiki/The_Crag" title="The Crag">the Crag</a>.

Talisa questions Robb about his betrothal; she asks about his future wife's beauty and he admits that he has not met her and that he only knows that she is from ​<a href="/wiki/House_Frey" title="House Frey">House Frey</a>. Talisa says that she is sure they will be very happy and they share a laugh. Talisa notes that Robb is marrying into House Frey because of a bridge, referring to <a href="/wiki/The_Twins" title="The Twins">the Twins</a>. Robb explains that the bridge was important, particularly at the time because his father was still alive and he believed that he could rescue him if he could cross. Talisa says that when she has spoken with people from <a href="/wiki/The_North" title="The North">the North</a> they have told her how much they loved <a href="/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>. Robb says that his father was the best man he has ever known, adding that all children think that about their fathers and beginning to explain that he truly believes it. Talisa interrupts him to say that not all children think that way. </p> <p>Robb relates a lesson his father gave him about being a lord; Eddard compared it to fatherhood but with thousands of children to protect. Eddard worried constantly about the people under his protection and feared letting them down. Robb says that he did not believe Eddard and questioned how a man can be brave when he is afraid. Eddard taught him that a man can only be brave when he is afraid. Talisa says that she would have liked to meet Eddard and Robb says that Eddard would have liked her. Talisa says that most lords are more concerned with selfish matters like gold and glory than the welfare of their people. Robb says that Eddard was not concerned with such things. Talisa wonders what Robb is focused on. He refutes the idea that he is fighting to become famous and asserts that he wants to go home. He adds that he wants his followers to go home safely too. Talisa asks why he does not just leave and he answers that they will not be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. He also says that he believes in justice. Talisa asks if he means beheading Joffrey and Robb says that it would be a start. </p> <p>A pair of riders flying a Stark pennant approach.

Robb demands that his mother tell him that news of her involvement in Jaime’s escape are not true. She says nothing and he goes on to ask her why. She says that she acted for her daughters. Robb says that Catelyn has betrayed him, talking over her protests, because she knew that he would not allow her to release Jaime but did it anyway. Catelyn explains that with news that Bran and Rickon were captured at Winterfell she knew that only one of her five children was free and could not stand it. </p> <p>Rickard interjects that one of his sons died fighting for Robb and that Jaime murdered <a href="/wiki/Torrhen_Karstark" title="Torrhen Karstark">another</a>. He says that Catelyn’s excuse for her treason is unacceptable when other families have suffered worse for Robb’s cause. Rickard says that he would kill himself as an offering to the gods if he could have his sons be in captivity but alive. Catelyn says that she grieves for Rickard’s sons but Rickard interrupts her to say that he does not want her grief but his vengeance, which she stole from him. Catelyn argues that killing Jaime could not buy life for Rickard’s children but that returning him might buy freedom for her daughters. </p> <p>Robb tells Catelyn that Jaime has played her for a fool. He says that her actions have weakened their position and brought discord into his camp all while acting behind his back. He orders Catelyn guarded day and night and ignores her protests. He asks a guard how many men they sent in pursuit of Jaime and then orders the number doubled from 40 to 80. </p> <h2 id="Scene_6" section="6">Scene 6</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":5}' data-ref="5"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Jaime_and_Brienne.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120523164028"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Jaime and Brienne.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Jaime_and_Brienne.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120523164028" alt="Jaime and Brienne.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Brienne escorting Jaime</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Brienne" title="Brienne" class="mw-redirect">Brienne</a> sends away the horse that she has used to get away from the camp.

She pulls him from his horse and sends it off too. She removes the hood from his head but leaves his wrists chained. Jaime says that she is much uglier in daylight. She drags him upright and leads him through the woodland. He asks her name and gets no answer. He introduces himself formally and says that a captive knight has the right to know their captors identity. Brienne reluctantly introduces herself. Jaime demonstrates that he knows the sigil of her house and the name of her father, <a href="/wiki/Selwyn_Tarth" title="Selwyn Tarth">Selwyn Tarth</a>. He asks if she has any siblings and she again keeps silent. He says that it is a long way to King’s Landing and they should get to know one another. He asks if she has known many men. Receiving more stoicism he jokes that she may have known women or horses. She pushes him to his knees beside a rowboat on a river bank. Jaime says that he did not mean to give offence. </p> <p>Brienne peers at a nearby bridge from behind foliage, waiting for a caravan to pass. Jaime asks for her forgiveness and she says that his crimes are beyond forgiveness, calling him Kingslayer. Jaime asks why she hates him and whether he has wronged her. She says that he has harmed others, including those he had sworn to protect. Jaime says that she is as boring as she is ugly. With the bridge clear she pulls him to his feet and says that he will not provoke her to anger. He says that he already has and that she is ready to murder him. Brienne prepares the rowboat as Jaime goads her. He asks if she believes that she could beat him in a fair fight. Brienne says that she has never seen him fight. Jaime insists that she would not stand a chance and that there are only three men in the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Kingdoms" title="Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a> who would. Brienne retorts that she has been sneered at by arrogant men throughout her entire life and has spent just as much time knocking those arrogant men into the dust. Jaime says that if she is so confident she should unlock his chains and see what happens. Brienne asks if Jaime thinks she is an idiot and orders him into the boat. Jaime says that he took her for a fighter and a woman of honor, correcting himself after initially referring to her as a man. Jaime claims that she is afraid to face him and she says that they might find out one day as she uses the oar to push the boat free from the bank. Brienne rows them downstream. </p> <h2 id="Scene_7" section="7">Scene 7</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":6}' data-ref="6"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/de/War_council.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730013911"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20748%20403'%2F%3E" alt="War council.jpg" width="748" height="403"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/d/de/War_council.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730013911" alt="War council.jpg" width="748" height="403"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Tywin hosts a war council at Harrenhal.</figcaption></figure><p>Lord <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a> holds a war council in his chambers at <a href="/wiki/Harrenhal" title="Harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>.

Tywin balks at surrendering the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a>. Kevan argues that giving up the throne is better than seeing the heads of their relatives mounted on the city gates, fearing that Stannis will execute any Lannister he finds in the city. Tywin rejects the suggestion, believing that a king who runs cannot remain king for long. <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a> serves drinks to Tywin and his bannermen, still incognito as Tywin’s cupbearer. Tywin insists that King <a href="/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon" title="Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey Baratheon</a> is a Lannister by blood and must stand and fight. </p> <p>Tywin complains that Stannis is just two days from King’s Landing while Robb Stark is on their doorstep in the Westerlands, referring to Robb as a wolf, a nod to the House Stark sigil. Arya smiles at the mention of her brother. Kevan reports word from their scouts that Robb remains north of <a href="/wiki/Ashemark" title="Ashemark">Ashemark</a>. Tywin laughs derisively and says that the last time their scouts assured them of Robb’s movements they were lured into a trap. Tywin blames their poor intelligence for the capture of Jaime. Tywin asserts that Robb has gotten too close to Casterly Rock. Kevan relays news that Robb has sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. Kevan theorizes that the Greyjoy’s seizure of Winterfell is a boon to them because Robb will not march against Casterly Rock until he is at full strength. Tywin dismisses the suggestion, saying that Robb is a boy who has never lost a battle which will make him impetuous. Tywin predicts that Robb will take risks because he does not know enough to be afraid. Tywin announces his orders; the army will ride out from Harrenhal at nightfall. Tywin wants to get a night’s march before Robb is aware that they are coming. He names Ser <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a> as his castellan at Harrenhal and orders him to continue his efforts against the <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_Without_Banners" title="Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</a>. Tywin assigns Arya to serve Gregor, saying that she has been a good servant. He instructs Arya not to allow Gregor to get drunk in the evenings, explaining that he is poor company sober but better at his work. </p> <h2 id="Scene_8" section="8">Scene 8</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":7}' data-ref="7"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Rorge_and_Biter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160729232359"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20740%20405'%2F%3E" alt="Rorge and Biter.jpg" width="740" height="405"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5e/Rorge_and_Biter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160729232359" alt="Rorge and Biter.jpg" width="740" height="405"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Arya looking for Jaqen but finding Rorge and Biter</figcaption></figure><p>Arya goes down to the courtyard of Harrenhal seeking <a href="/wiki/Jaqen_H%E2%80%99ghar" title="Jaqen H’ghar" class="mw-redirect">Jaqen H’ghar</a>.

Qhorin says that he should have known better than to trust a traitorous bastard and pushes Jon down the slope. The Lord of Bones warns Qhorin that Jon is not his to kill. Ygritte waits for Jon to right himself, looking at him thoughtfully. </p> <h2 id="Scene_11" section="11">Scene 11</h2> <p><a href="/wiki/Bronn" title="Bronn">Bronn</a> cleans his fingernails in Tyrion’s chamber. Tyrion sits opposite him poring through stacks of books. Tyrion asks if he has to do that in his rooms and Bronn replies that he likes to keep his hands clean. Tyrion again asks if Bronn specifically needs to do it there. Bronn looks across at him and then stops. Tyrion asks Bronn to start wearing a gold cloak to signify his status as Lord Commander of the City Watch. Bronn flatly refuses, reasoning that a cloak slows you down in a fight and makes it difficult to move stealthily. Tyrion points out that his new role obviates the need for sneaking around. Bronn maintains that wearing a gold cloak was not part of their deal. Tyrion reluctantly accepts the argument and returns to his reading. Bronn continues to stare at Tyrion, annoying him further. Bronn complains that Tyrion will not allow him to clean his nails or look at him and wonders why he is there. Tyrion explains that he wants Bronn to help him to plan the defense of King’s Landing. Bronn stands up and then picks up one of the books, asking if it can tell them how to beat Stannis. Tyrion turns to the front cover of his current tome and reads the title aloud “An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros” by Archmaester Ch’Vyalthan. Tyrion stumbles over the pronunciation of the scholar’s name and Bronn corrects him. Bronn throws the book back onto the pile and says that he would swap all of them for a few good archers. </p> <p>Lord <a href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a> enters and greets them both. Varys unctuously compliments Bronn on the Gold Cloaks performance, explaining to Tyrion that they have reduced the rate of theft in the city. Tyrion wonders how Bronn accomplished the improvement. Bronn admits that they rounded up all of the known thieves. Tyrion asks if they were questioned and Bronn declines to say more, adding that they need only worry about the unknown thieves from now on. Tyrion says that they spoke about such brutal methods and Bronn agrees that they did. Bronn then questions if they have ever been in a city under siege. They do not answer and Bronn suggests that he knows something that might not be in the books. He elucidates that starvation is the great killer of a siege and that food becomes the most valuable commodity during a siege. He says that if things are bad enough the poor will turn to cannibalism while the rich will give away their most valued possessions in exchange for simple provisions. He says that the thieves prosper most in a siege. Varys agrees that extreme measures are warranted under the circumstances. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":10}' data-ref="10"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/Tyrion%2C_Varys_and_Bronn.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160829160604"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Tyrion, Varys and Bronn.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/78/Tyrion%2C_Varys_and_Bronn.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160829160604" alt="Tyrion, Varys and Bronn.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Bronn, Varys and Tyrion strategize</figcaption></figure><p>Varys notices what Tyrion is reading.

Tyrion gives Bronn an "Ah, that's how it's said" gesture upon Varys's pronunciation of the name. Tyrion reaches for a map and says that Stannis knows King’s Landing.

Tyrion points out that there are younger boys fighting in Joffrey’s war. Cersei insists that Joffrey is not ready and Tyrion asserts that 17 is old enough, asking Cersei to consider Jaime at that age. Cersei argues that some men are gifted for fighting, implying that Joffrey is not and insisting that he should not be on the battlefield. Tyrion retorts that Joffrey should not be on the throne either, sadly for his people and shares a smile with Podrick. Cersei is unamused and angrily asks Tyrion if he thinks that she is an idiot.

She was aged 12 and was left to care for her little brother. It was the hottest part of the three year summer so they ran down to the river Rhoyne to bathe. The river was busy with children swimming nude between the shore and the small islands. There were drummers playing for coppers on the eastern bank. She was treading water and talking to a friend when she realized that she had not seen her brother for some time. She looked for him, screamed for him but could not see him. She eventually spotted him floating face down in the water. They dragged him ashore and she screamed at him to breathe but feared that he was already dead. She was astounded when a slave from a fishing boat, recognizable from the fish tattooed on his face, rushed over and pushed her aside. She explains to Robb that it is a crime punishable by death for a slave to touch a noble like that. She says that the slave showed no regard for his own life in rushing to her brother’s side. The man pounded on her brother’s chest until he coughed up all the water he had swallowed and returned to them. The man cradled her brother and told him to be calm. She confides that the incident caused her to vow not to waste her time on the trivial concerns of the nobility and once she came of age never to live in a slave city again. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":17}' data-ref="17"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/22/Robb_and_Talisa1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730014423"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Robb and Talisa1.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/22/Robb_and_Talisa1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730014423" alt="Robb and Talisa1.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Robb and Talisa kiss</figcaption></figure><p>She apologizes for going on when Robb had shared his problems.

They are still for a moment and she then kisses him tenderly. </p> <h2 id="Scene_17" section="17">Scene 17</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":18}' data-ref="18"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Escaping_Harrenhal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718191253"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Escaping Harrenhal.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Escaping_Harrenhal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718191253" alt="Escaping Harrenhal.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption><a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hot_Pie" title="Hot Pie">Hot Pie</a> escaping Harrenhal.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya Stark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hot_Pie" title="Hot Pie">Hot Pie</a> gather in the shadows opposite the courtyard gate at <a href="/wiki/Harrenhal" title="Harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>.

Stannis walks across the deck with Davos and Davos’s son <a href="/wiki/Matthos_Seaworth" title="Matthos Seaworth">Matthos</a> watches them pass. </p> <p>Stannis says that he admires Davos and Davos thanks him for the compliment. Stannis explains that he is referring to the way Davos has handled the snobbery of the highborn. He says that Davos was clever to claim the name “Onion Knight” for his own by taking the onion for his sigil. Davos admits that his son has suggested changing it and claims to understand why older families look down on him. Stannis asks him to expand on that and Davos says that it is because he is the son of a crabber. Davos believes that they hate having to eat with him, joking that it is because crabber’s hands stink.

He references Robert granting Storm’s End to <a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly</a> after the war despite Renly not fighting. Davos excuses Renly as being only a boy and Stannis counters by wondering why Robert then rewarded him. Davos has no response. </p> <p>Stannis goes on to detail the horrors of the siege. He confides that they ate the animals within the keep, starting with their horses because they could not ride anywhere with the <a href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a> host at their gates and could not feed them so he accepted eating them. He says that they ate the cats next, which he accepted having never liked cats. He was more affected when they had to eat their dogs because he respects dogs as a loyal animal. He was appalled when they were reduced to eating rats. He reached the point where he thought his wife <a href="/wiki/Selyse_Baratheon" title="Selyse Baratheon">Selyse</a> was going to die because she was so frail that she could not speak. The next night Davos arrived, smuggling a boatload of onions through the fleet picketing the surrounding sea. Davos reminds Stannis that he also brought potatoes and salted beef.
