Matthos tells his father that the tide is against them but Davos assures him that with the wind will blow them straights to the gates of the city. Matthos says that Davos is coming home. Davos replies that he has not called King’s Landing home for twenty years. He observes that he has spent most of his life dodging the royal fleet and is now sailing towards them. Matthos corrects Davos that they are the royal fleet, he points out that Davos is no longer a smuggler and is the fleet’s High Captain. Davos counters that there are several royal fleets at that time. Matthos says that they will change things; that Stannis will be on the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a> when the sun rises and Davos will be his <a href="/wiki/Hand_of_the_King" title="Hand of the King">Hand</a>. Davos affirms the assertion “Gods be good.” Matthos corrects him again, saying that there is just one god and that he is watching over them. Davos wonders if the Lord of Light watches over their enemies as well. Matthos says that he watches over all people and says that the people of King’s Landing did not choose the false King <a href="/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon" title="Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey Baratheon</a>. Matthos asserts that the people will be glad to see Joffrey’s head on a spike. Davos reminds him that they must put it there first. Matthos is confident of victory, saying that their ships outnumber their opponent’s 10 to 1 while their army outnumbers their opponent’s 5 to 1. Davos warns that the city walls have never been breached. He says that the men guarding the walls will not see them as liberators but as strangers who have come to set their city ablaze. Matthos asserts his faith in the Lord of Light, their cause and his captain. </p> <h2 id="Scene_5" section="5">Scene 5</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":7}' data-ref="7"><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/Tyrion_and_Shae_in_bed.png/revision/latest?cb=20160817050927"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="Tyrion and Shae in bed.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/27/Tyrion_and_Shae_in_bed.png/revision/latest?cb=20160817050927" alt="Tyrion and Shae in bed.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Tyrion lies in bed with Shae.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> lies restless in bed next to <a href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_the_Hand" title="Tower of the Hand">Tower of the Hand</a>.

Shae says that she will not let anyone hurt him. He smiles at her before explaining that while he is a Lannister and has no choice in his side, it is not her war and she can leave. She straddles him and says that it is her fight now. Tyrion jokes that Shae cannot “fuck [her] way out of everything.” She counters that it has worked so far. She asks if he can remember what he said when they first met in his tent at the Lannister army camp. She reminds him that he told her to make love to him like it was his last day on earth.

He thanks her and she goes on to say that she likes his nose. She asks him how many times he has broken it. Bronn lifts her up and begins to undress her while he recalls. He says that his mother hit him with an iron poker when he was five and she makes a sympathetic noise. Bronn excuses his mother by saying that she was aiming for his younger brother who was a real pest. He says that he was nine the second time and lost a fight with a group of older boys. He begins to tell about the third time but stops when he has undressed her. He leans back to look at her appreciatively. He pulls her into his lap and says that she does not want to hear about the third time. She kisses his nose and offers her sympathy. He tells her not feel sorry for it because it will be half way up her “ass before the night is through.” He again gets a laugh from the crowd of men. </p> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":10}' data-ref="10"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Bronn%27s_knife.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718194056"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="Bronn's knife.jpg" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1f/Bronn%27s_knife.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160718194056" alt="Bronn's knife.jpg" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Bronn ready to kill The Hound.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Sandor_Clegane" title="Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</a> enters with a drinking companion, silencing the men.

The Hound only stares at him in response. Bronn whispers to <a href="/wiki/Armeca" title="Armeca">Armeca</a> that he does not think that the Hound likes him. Sandor downs his drink and watches Bronn looking at Armeca. The Hound asks Bronn if he thinks that he is a hard man. Bronn laughs, gently spanks Armeca and says that he knows he is. The men laugh at his bawdy reference. Bronn says that they have a warm room, beautiful women and plenty of good brown ale to drink. He wonders why Sandor only wants to put one of them in the ground with no women to keep them company. Sandor counters that there are plenty of women in the ground and that he has put some there himself, as has Bronn. The Hound asserts that while Bronn likes singing, drinking and women he truly loves killing. He says that they are the same, only Bronn is smaller. He stands up. Bronn points at him and adds that he is quicker. The Hound says that Tyrion will miss Bronn. Bronn taps Armeca and she shifts away so that he can stand up. Bronn reaches for the dagger he keeps at the small of his back as he squares off to the Hound. They are interrupted by the ringing of bells, summoning the men to arms. The soldiers finish their drinks and leave. Bronn suggests another drink before the war. The Hound turns away from him and Bronn smiles. </p> <h2 id="Scene_8" section="8">Scene 8</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":11}' data-ref="11"><a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Varys_Tyrion_Podrick.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041606"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="Varys Tyrion Podrick.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/90/Varys_Tyrion_Podrick.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041606" alt="Varys Tyrion Podrick.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Lord Varys visits Tyrion while he gets armored by Podrick.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a> visits Tyrion in his chambers as he prepares for the battle.

Varys says that he is unsure what Tyrion is suggesting and Tyrion insists that Varys knows exactly what he means. Varys asks Tyrion if he trusts Podrick. Tyrion looks at his squire and says that he does, strangely. Varys unfurls a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. Tyrion looks down at it and estimates that it shows twenty miles of tunnels. Varys corrects him, saying that there are fifty and elucidating that the Targaryens built the city to withstand a siege but wanted to be able to escape if necessary. Tyrion says that he is not planning to escape and paints himself as the captain of a <a href="/wiki/Ships" title="Ships">ship</a>; willing to go down with it if it sinks. Varys retorts that many captains say the same while their ships are afloat. Varys observes that Tyrion looks well suited for battle as Podrick helps him into his greaves.

Tyrion wonders about the significance of the association. Varys asks if Tyrion does not believe in the old powers. Tyrion recounts their purported abilitities (blood spells, curses and shapeshifting) and sarcastically asks Varys what he thinks. Varys says that people believe in what they have seen and what those they trust have seen. Varys extrapolates that Tyrion probably does not entirely trust him. Tyrion tells Varys not to take it personally, explaining that he does not entirely trust himself. Varys goes on to say that he has seen and heard things that Tyrion has not. He confides that he wishes he had not either, his eyes misting. He asks if he has told Tyrion how he was castrated and Tyrion answers that he has not. Varys says that he will one day. He gather himself and asserts that the dark arts have provided Stannis with his armies and brought him to their door. Varys says that he can think of nothing worse than a man in service to such powers taking the Iron Throne. He tells Tyrion that he is the only man who can stop Stannis. Podrick offers Tyrion a battle axe. Tyrion looks at it and grips it firmly in his hand before looking back at Varys. </p> <h2 id="Scene_9" section="9">Scene 9</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":13}' data-ref="13"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ec/War_bell.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041648"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="War bell.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/e/ec/War_bell.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041648" alt="War bell.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>The bells ring for war.</figcaption></figure><p>Bell ringers continue to sound the alarm over King’s Landing. </p> <h2 id="Scene_10" section="10">Scene 10</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":14}' data-ref="14"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1e/War_drums.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041713"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201600%20900'%2F%3E" alt="War drums.png" width="1600" height="900"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1e/War_drums.png/revision/latest?cb=20160730041713" alt="War drums.png" width="1600" height="900"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Drums summon the men to arms.</figcaption></figure><p>The sound of the bells carries out into the bay, reaching Davos and <a href="/wiki/Matthos" title="Matthos" class="mw-redirect">Matthos</a> aboard the <a href="/wiki/Black_Betha" title="Black Betha">Black Betha</a>.

Sansa affirms that she has, but explains that King Joffrey has summoned her to see him off. Joffrey, the Hound and three other members of the Kingsguard enter from behind the throne. Joffrey calls Sansa over yelling, "Sansa, here," much as one would call a dog. Tyrion deadpans that Joffrey has always been a great romantic. Sansa says that she will pray for Tyrion’s safe return. Tyrion seems surprised that she would care, but when she says that she will pray just as she will for the king, he realizes that she may be praying, but her prayers are not for the Lannisters' well being or success. Sansa goes to Joffrey leaving Tyrion alone with Shae and they share a heartfelt moment.

Joffrey claims that Sansa will kiss it again when he returns and will taste his uncle’s blood. Sansa asks if Joffrey will slay Stannis himself. Joffrey hesitantly says that he will if Stannis is fool enough to come near him. Sansa asks if Joffrey will be fighting outside the gates as part of the vanguard. Joffrey knows that he will not be anywhere near the fighting, and that she has caught him in a false boast. He angrily tells her that he refuses to discuss his battle plans with a “stupid girl.” Sansa apologizes and agrees that she is stupid before asserting that Joffrey would definitely be in the vanguard. She adds that her brother <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a> always goes where the fighting is thickest, and Robb is only a pretender. Joffrey is furious, so he says that Robb’s turn will come and that Sansa can then lick his blood from Hearteater as well. Joffrey leads his men out of the throne room, and Sansa returns to Shae.

She muses that Sansa would not and elucidates that should the city fall all the women there will be raped. Cersei predicts that half of them will be carrying bastard children by the morning. She tells Sansa that she will be glad of her period then. Cersei asserts that when a man’s blood is up from battle then any woman looks good, so Sansa will look like a slice of cake waiting to be eaten.

She could not understand why they were treated differently. She complains that while she was being taught to be a lady Jaime was being taught to fight. She says that Jaime was heir to <a href="/wiki/Casterly_Rock" title="Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</a> while she was sold to a stranger like a horse. Sansa reminds her that the marriage made her queen of the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Kingdoms" title="Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a>. Cersei counters that Sansa will be Joffrey’s queen and invites her to enjoy it. </p> <p>Cersei notices Shae watching them from across the room and says that she has not seen her before. Cersei approaches Shae and calls her pretty. Shae stands and attempts to curtsey. Cersei calls it the worst she has ever seen and demonstrates how to do it properly. Shae mimics her movements and Cersei says that she learns quickly. She asks how long Shae has served Sansa and Shae tells her it has been just a few weeks. Cersei instantly recognizes her Lorathi accent and asks when she left there. Cersei does not wait for an answer and observes that Shae is lowborn. Shae’s smile fades and Cersei asks when she came to Westeros. Shae says that it was ten years ago. Cersei wonders how Shae went from a Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years without being able to curtsey. She asks Shae’s name and asks her to tell her story. Shae hesitates and then begins at the age of thirteen. </p> <p>Shae is rescued by the arrival of Lancel. He bursts in shouting for Cersei. He reports Tyrion’s destruction of the fleet and the landing of Stannis’s troops. Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey inside. He objects saying that the presence of the King is good for morale. Cersei again tells Lancel to bring Joffrey back to his chambers. Lancel wonders why not to her side and she sarcastically asks if he wants Joffrey to be mocked as a coward for hiding behind his mother’s skirts. </p> <p>Cersei sits back down and reveals to Sansa that she lied about Ser Ilyn’s purpose. She holds out an unsteady arm for more wine as she explains that he is there to kill them should the Red Keep be breached. </p> <h2 id="Scene_26" section="26">Scene 26</h2> <div class="article-media-gallery gallery" data-component="article-media-gallery" data-attrs='{"ref":1}' data-ref="1"> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="1"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0f/Soldiers_at_the_mud_gate.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720032120"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Soldiers_at_the_mud_gate.jpg" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/0f/Soldiers_at_the_mud_gate.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160720032120" alt="Soldiers_at_the_mud_gate.jpg" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Baratheon pushing the Lannister soldiers fighting back through the Mud Gate.</figcaption></figure><figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-ref="1"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Ladders_up%21.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730030652"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201366%20768'%2F%3E" alt="Ladders_up!.jpg" width="1366" height="768"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/43/Ladders_up%21.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160730030652" alt="Ladders_up!.jpg" width="1366" height="768"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>The ladders are brought to breach the castle walls</figcaption></figure> </div> <p>The Hound and his men fight on outside the gate.

Tyrion looks around at his muttering troops and says to himself that he will lead the attack. He shouts it to his men and is met with more murmurs. He orders Ser Mandon to bear the king’s banner and then shouts for his men to form up. Several gold cloaks among the group turn away from him. He calls out that he is mocked as half a man and wonders what that makes them. A Lannister soldier calls that they cannot counterattack because Stannis’s men are already at the gates. Tyrion says that there is another way that he can show them. He says they will emerge behind their enemies. He tells his men not to fight for Joffrey or his kingdom, for honor, for glory or for riches because they will not get any. He asks them to fight for their city. He says that if Stannis gets in he will burn their houses and rape their women. His speech is punctuated by the hammering of the ram against the gate. He says that there are brave men knocking at their door and invites the defenders to go and kill them.

Stannis continues to battle atop the walls but has not been joined by enough men to move on. While the threat of breaching the Mud Gate–the easiest way into the city–has been stopped, Tyrion's counterattack was costly. It has also put much of the city's garrison in danger of annihilation, and even if they successfully withdraw back into the city Stannis' new forces will eventually put up more ladders to join their leader and breach the wall. </p> <p>Tyrion is disarmed by a Baratheon soldier with a mace.
