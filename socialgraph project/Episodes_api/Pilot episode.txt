A heavily re-shot version of the pilot, with new material directed by <a href="/wiki/Tim_Van_Patten" title="Tim Van Patten">Tim Van Patten</a>, serves as the actual first episode of Season 1, "<a href="/wiki/Winter_is_Coming" title="Winter is Coming">Winter is Coming</a>". It is not known if the original pilot will ever be publicly screened or released. </p> <p>Because several scenes shot by McCarthy remain in the finished episode, and because McCarthy helped cast several of the regular cast, he was given a "Consulting Producer" credit on the first episode. </p> <p><br></p> <h2 id="Production" section="1">Production</h2> <p>The pilot was shot between October 24th and November 19th, 2009, on location in Northern Ireland and Morocco. </p> <p>The pilot episode was the culmination of about four years of work by scriptwriters <a href="/wiki/David_Benioff" title="David Benioff">David Benioff</a> and <a href="/wiki/D.B._Weiss" title="D.B. Weiss">D.B. Weiss</a> to make an adaptation of the <i><a href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels as a TV series for <a href="/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> - including all of the time spent negotiating, pre-planning, designing and constructing sets, props, and costumes, casting, and writing. </p> <p>Benioff and Weiss never anticipated having to refilm the pilot episode. After they finished, however, they showed a rough cut to their friend and fellow scriptwriter Craig Mazin (known for writing the scripts to <i>The Hangover</i> series's sequels and <i>Identify Thief</i>). They expected Mazin to give them a few written notes on points to refine, but instead the only thing he wrote on the notepad he handed back to them was "MASSIVE PROBLEM" spelled out in capital letters.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup></p> <p>Both Mazin and HBO felt that there were massive problems with the pilot episode, which devastated Benioff and Weiss - even years later, after <a href="/wiki/Season_5" title="Season 5">Season 5</a>, they explained that this had a massive emotional impact on them, and they considered it the low point of their careers, only regaining their mood when they decided to take the unorthodox step of outright re-filming almost the entire first episode (about 90% of it by their guess) and learn from their mistakes. </p> <p>Benioff and Weiss therefore took several of Mazin's criticisms to heart, among which was that the exposition was too clunky. Unlike a novel, TV audiences only have a finite attention span for information during a live episode airing: some scenes had too much exposition that a new audience unfamiliar with the novels couldn't possibly hope to remember, while other scenes didn't have enough exposition. Particularly, a major criticism Benioff and Weiss have frequently noted was that many people at private screenings of the pilot such as Mazin didn't even understand the familial relationships of the major characters - specifically, didn't even realize that Cersei and Jaime Lannister are brother and sister, or that Tyrion is their brother. In reworked scenes for the new first episode, "Winter is Coming", Benioff and Weiss therefore made it a point to emphasize this: in Jaime and Cersei's first scene he goes out of his way to say "as your brother I need to tell you..." etc., and also dubbed in off-screen voiceovers have characters shout "It's Tyrion the imp! The Queen's brother!" etc. Benioff and Weiss also discussed this in the Blu-ray commentary for Season 1, in which they chuckled and acknowledged that this exposition was broad and obvious, but they had learned from painful experience with the pilot episode that it was actually quite necessary.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup></p> <h2 id="Differences_between_pilot_and_series" section="2">Differences between pilot and series</h2> <p>The pilot episode has a notably different cast than the rest of the series.

Tommen gets repeatedly knocked down by Bran, though Tommen shows great sportsmanship, keeps getting up, and is appreciative that Bran gave him the opportunity to spar with another boy his age (Cersei apparently coddled her sons and prevented them from engaging in martial training, like most other boys their ages). A brief shot seen in one of the behind-the-scenes production featurettes actually does show one of the small boys in protective training gear and armed with a wooden sword, so apparently such a scene <i>was</i> originally filmed, but in later drafts was cut for time. </p> <p>Also, the German folk band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_Corax_(band)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Corvus Corax (band)">Corvus Corax</a> appeared as minstrels at the Winterfell feast.
