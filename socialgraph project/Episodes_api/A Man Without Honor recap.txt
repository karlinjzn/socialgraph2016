Lorren says that <a href="/wiki/Hodor" title="Hodor">Hodor</a> must have taken Bran, referring to the stable hand as a giant. Theon is incredulous at Lorren’s description and says that he has been outfoxed by a cripple and a halfwit.

Theon and his men follow the trackers on horseback. Dagmer calls a halt as the hounds become confused. Maester <a href="/wiki/Luwin" title="Luwin">Luwin</a> accompanies the hunt and Theon asks if he is enjoying it. Luwin deadpans that hunting seems similar to riding. Theon responds that hunting has blood at the end and Luwin reminds him that the escapees are just little boys. Theon retorts that he was a little boy once but always kept his word and never fled from his captivity with <a href="/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a>. Theon says that if he finds their quarry soon he will punish them for daring to run, but let them live. Luwin warns that the boys have far more value alive and Theon counters that they have no value to him missing. Luwin changes tack warning that King <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> will have sent a force to retake Winterfell.

Osha argues that the people of Winterfell love the Starks and would have done anything for them. Bran responds that he was not willing to endanger the lives of his people by exposing them to Theon’s wrath. Osha says that Rickon cannot survive on walnuts alone, but Rickon says that he is fine. Hodor cracks a walnut for him in the palms of his hands. Osha frets that they have been walking for hours and says that even Hodor will tire. Hodor responds by repeating his name, and Osha affectionately calls him a sweet giant. </p> <p>They crest a hill, and Bran asks them to wait, recognizing a distant farm.

Jon tells her to be quiet and she accuses him of feeling superior to her. She asserts her independence as a free woman and he laughs, reminding her that she is his prisoner. She says that her freedom stems from not being beholden to oaths or lords. She says that Jon’s oath has cost him his freedom to pursue women. She says that rather than pursuing sex the Night’s Watch is invading their lands.

He orders Arya to sit and tells her that she is small for her age and will not grow if she does not eat. He presumes that she has always been underfed and she says that she eats a lot but does not grow. He walks to the window and muses on his legacy. He says that the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Five_Kings" title="War of the Five Kings">War of the Five Kings</a> will be his last, win or lose. Arya wonders if he has ever lost and he counters that he would not be in his position if he had. He says that he will be remembered for this war and that nothing matters but how it ends. As he speaks Arya fixates on the veins of his neck, gripping her knife. </p> <p>Tywin asks her if she knows what legacy means and she shakes her head. He explains that he is talking about what he will pass on to his family after he is gone. He says that <a href="/wiki/Harren_Hoare" title="Harren Hoare">Harren the Black</a> considered Harrenhal his legacy. Tywin describes Harrenhal as the greatest castle ever built, with the tallest towers and strongest walls. He says that the great hall had 35 hearths and asks Arya to imagine it. He asks her to look at what it has been reduced to, calling it a blasted ruin. He asks if she knows what happened and she correctly says that the castle was ruined by dragons. He is impressed and elucidates that Harrenhal was designed to repel an attack from the land and was capable of withstanding assault by a million men. He explains that it was left vulnerable to attack from the air with dragonfire. He says that Harren and all of his sons were roasted alive in the castle by <a href="/wiki/Aegon_Targaryen" title="Aegon Targaryen" class="mw-redirect">Aegon Targaryen</a> and his dragon. </p> <p>Tywin says that Aegon is remembered 300 years later because he changed the rules.

Tywin notes that Arya’s recall exceeds his own, saying that he is sure he knew their names when he was a boy. Arya continues that Visenya was a great warrior and Tywin realizes that she is a heroine to Arya. He notes that her interests are distinct from most girls who idolize romantic legends from songs like <a href="/wiki/Jonquil" title="Jonquil">Jonquil</a> with flowers in her hair. Arya says that most girls are idiots and Tywin laughs, saying that she reminds him of his daughter <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a>. </p> <p>Tywin questions where Arya learned about history and she claims that she was taught by her father. Tywin is dubious about the idea of a well read stonemason, saying that he has never met one. Arya asks if he has met many stonemasons and he warns her to be careful with her tone, saying that he enjoys her but has limits. He orders her to return the meal to the kitchen to finish it there. He criticizes her pronunciation of “My Lord,” warning her that lowborn girls say “Milord.” He says that if she is going to pose as a commoner she should do it properly and she claims that she was taught to speak properly by her mother, a maid to Lady Dustin. Tywin says that she is too smart for her own good and dismisses her. </p> <h2 id="Scene_8" section="8">Scene 8</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":8}' data-ref="8"><a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/Sansa_and_the_hound.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160719035858"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Sansa and the hound.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/Sansa_and_the_hound.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160719035858" alt="Sansa and the hound.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Sansa talking to Sandor</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a> seeks out <a href="/wiki/Sandor_Clegane" title="Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</a> inside the <a href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a> of <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing" title="King's Landing">King's Landing</a>.

Jaime cannot recall Jon’s name and asks Catelyn what it was. She calls for Brienne, and he jokes that it wasn’t that. He asks if she pretended to love Jon when Eddard first brought him home. He notes that she is no good at pretending as an honest woman and deduces that she showed her hatred. He says that Jon is a walking talking reminder of Eddard’s infidelity. Catelyn orders Brienne to hand over her sword. </p> <h2 id="Scene_31" section="31">Scene 31</h2> <figure class="article-media-thumbnail" data-component="article-media-thumbnail" data-attrs='{"ref":37}' data-ref="37"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/af/Burned_bodies.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160719232539"> <img class="article-media-placeholder" src="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20768%20432'%2F%3E" alt="Burned bodies.jpg" width="768" height="432"><noscript> <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/af/Burned_bodies.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160719232539" alt="Burned bodies.jpg" width="768" height="432"> </noscript> </a> <figcaption>Theon's exhibition of children's corpses</figcaption></figure><p>Theon assembles the people of Winterfell in the courtyard and addresses them from a raised platform. He says that he warned them what would happen to anyone that betrayed him. Dagmer drags Maester Luwin into the courtyard and Luwin demands to know what they have done. Theon says that there are people among them who question whether he means what he says. He gestures to the standards hanging from the walls and says that he has the answer to their question. His men raise the charred corpses of two children in front of the banners to appalled gasps from the crowd. Theon looks back at them and cannot conceal his own horror. Dagmer grins as Luwin is overwhelmed by grief and cries out. </p>
